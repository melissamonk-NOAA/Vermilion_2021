### \acrlong{s-aslope}

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V _Miller Freeman_.
Partial survey coverage of the US west coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001.
Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

<!--chapter:end:21s-aslope.Rmd-->

### \acrlong{s-ccfrp}

Since 2007, the \Gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \Gls{mpa}s
and understand nearshore fish populations
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015].
In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas)
to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \Gls{cpfv}s guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location:
Humboldt State University;
Bodega Marine Laboratories;
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories;
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo;
University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \Gls{mpa}s.
Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth;
since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.


<!--chapter:end:21s-ccfrp.Rmd-->

### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

<!--chapter:end:21s-tri.RMd-->

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast.
Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability,
as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.
