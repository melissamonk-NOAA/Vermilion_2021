`r Spp` are not well sampled by the following studies we considered as possible 
data sources.

*NWFSC Triennial Survey*

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey 
continued until 2004 [@Dark1994].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across 
the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower 
than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the 
data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 
36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the 
southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and 
surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} 
conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.


*Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey* 

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the 
R/V _Miller Freeman_.
Partial survey coverage of the US West Coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 
and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the 
years 1997 and 1999-2001.
Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included 
in assessments.


*Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans*

The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans, 
[PISCO-UCSC](http://www.piscoweb.org/kelp-forest-study), conducts a number of surveys 
to monitor the kelp forests, one of which is a kelp forest fish survey. PISCO
has monitored fish population in the 0-20 m depth range as part of the 
Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) since 1998.  Paired sites inside and outside MPAs 
are surveyed to monitor the long-term dynamics of the kelp forest ecosystem and provide 
insight into the effect of MPAs on kelp forest species. PISCO conducts the fish 
surveys from late July through September. At each site, benthic, midwater, and canopy 
scuba transects are conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 20 m depth.  All divers are trained 
in species identification.  Along each 30 m transect, divers enumerate all identifiable 
non-cryptic fish, and measure total length to the nearest centimeter.  PISCO surveys 
are conducted by the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in central California and 
through the University of California Santa Barbara in southern California. 

*California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations* 

The \gls(calcofi) in 1951 and conducts quarterly cruises off southern & central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data on station and underway.  
Ichthyoplankon sampling with a paired bongo started in 1978. Data on larval abundance from the CalCOFI Ichthyoplankton survey have been used in stock assessments of several species, including bocaccio, cowcod and shortbelly rockfish.  Although the long-term dataset is limited to a small subset of species for which morphological identification of larvae has been possible, recent research has been successful at identifying a broader range of species based on genetic identification of larvae [@Thompson2016]. 
Vermilion rockfish cannot be identified morphologically in the ichthyoplankton 
samples. Of over 20,000 larvae identified in the 1998-2013 time period, only 9 were vermilion rockfish, encountered in only about 1% of the hauls.  Consequently, the data are insufficient at this time to use to inform relative abundance, although [@Thompson2017] do provide several relative abundance time series for other taxa, and future efforts may lead to better taxonomic resolution of historical or future collections.

*Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Survey*

Since 1983, the SWFSC has conducted an annual midwater trawl survey for pelagic juvenile rockfish and other groundfish in the Central California region of the California Current ([-@Ralston2013] and references therein).  Due to concerns about mesoscale abundance patterns and a need for greater spatial representation in the data, including some apparent strong differences in spatial distribution patterns in the early 2000s [@Hastie2007; @Ralston2013b], this survey was expanded to a broader spatial scale in the 2001-2004 period, and since 2004 most years have coastwide data from a combination of SWFSC, NWFSC and Cooperative Research surveys (see[-@Field2017] for more complete details regarding coastwide pre-recruit data, and [-@Sakuma2016], [@Friedman2018] for additional details and alternative applications of survey data).
