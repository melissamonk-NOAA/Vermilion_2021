## Summary of Previous Assessments and Reviews

### History of Modeling Approaches

This is the first full assessment for vermilion rockfish. 
Vermilon was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using 
Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) [@Dick2010]. The DB-SRA 
model assigned a frog% probability that the then recent (2008-2009) catch 
exceeded the 2010 OFL.

A 2005 assessment was not accepted for management and a 2013 data moderate 
assessment was prepared, but not reviewed.
