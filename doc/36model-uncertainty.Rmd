### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and over natural mortality 
values separately with the post-STAR base. These likelihood profiles were conducted by 
fixing the parameter 
at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter 
value (Tables frog).
