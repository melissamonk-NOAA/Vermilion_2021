\textbf{California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program Index}

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program, \href{https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/}{CCFRP},
is a fishery-independent
hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling
locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs along the central California coast
{[}@Wendt2009; @Starr2015{]}. The CCFRP survey began in 2007 and was originally
designed as a statewide program in collaboration with NMFS scientists and fishermen.
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored
four MPAs consistently. In 2017,
the program was expanded coastwide within California. The index of abundance was
developed from the four MPAs sampled consistently (AÃ±o Nuevo and Point Lobos
by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists a number 500 x 500 m cells both within and
outside each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly
selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells). CPFVs are chartered
for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for
a fishing location. During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of
30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured,
and can be linked back to a particular angler, and released (or descended to depth).
Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin
clips that provide needed biological information for nearshore species. For the index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the
fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.

\emph{CCFRP Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little
filtering was needed for the index.
Cells not consistently sampled over time were excluded as well as cells that never encountered vermilion. CCFRP samples shallower
depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality. We retained 5444 drifts for index standardization, with 1927 drifts encountering vermilion.

\emph{CCFRP Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-region-ccfrp} and \ref{tab:tab-year-ccfrp}.
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour)
a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar
in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-ccfrp}). Plots of the arithmetic
mean by inside (MPA) and outside (REF) MPAs over time is in Figure \ref{fig:fig-sitecpue-ccfrp}.

A negative binomial model was fit to the drift-level data (catch with a log offset for angler
hours). Because the averaged observed CPUE inside MPAs and in the reference sites exhibited
differing trends, we explored a YEAR:SITE interaction, which was selected as the best
fit model by AIC Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-ccfrp}), The final model included
YEAR and AREA and SITE and DEPTH\_bin and YEAR:SITE and offset(logEffort).
The model was fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-ccfrp} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-ccfrp}). The negative binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the 65\% zeroes in the observed data
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-ccfrp}). The predicted marginal effects from the model can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dnbin-marginal-ccfrp}).

Based on work completed at the SWFSC, we estimate that the percent of rocky reef habitat from Point Conception to the California border within California state waters is 892 \(km^2\), of which approximately 23\% is in MPAs that prohibit the harvest of groundfish (pers comm. Rebecca Miller, UCSC). There is recreational fishing outside of state waters, but habitat maps are not available at the same 2-m resolution and do not allow for direct comparisons. High-resolution habitat maps are not available for the state waters south of Point Conception.

The final index was weighted, giving 20\% of the model weight to MPAs and 80\% of model
weight to the ``open'' areas within the state. The CCFRP index includes all of the
MPAs currently sampled from 2017-2020 and the core central California sampling sites
from 2007-2016. Trends among all of the MPAs sampled increased along the entire coast
from 2017-2020. The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-ccfrp})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-ccfrp}).

To visualize the affect of weighting on the index, Figure (\ref{fig:fig-weighted-cpue-ccfrp})
shows the unweighted index and the index with 10-60\% of the weight given to MPAs versus
open areas. Each of these indices are scaled to their means to allow for direct comparison.
