\textbf{California Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019}

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling
program in 1999 {[}@Monk2014{]}. California Polytechnic State University (Cal
Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows
the protocols established in Reilly et al. {[}-@Reilly1998{]}.

During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records
location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset
of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a
maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.\\
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather
to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and
ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures
discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter
the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for vermilion rockfish .
Cal Poly has modified protocols reflect sampling changes that CDFW
has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at
the level of a fisher's bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in
the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019. The only difference is that
Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either
CDFW or Cal Poly in 2020.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical
in that the same protocols are followed. The only difference is that Cal Poly
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index
selectivity is mirrored to the recreational
fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead)
fish. Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length
from CDFW sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and included in the
length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model.

A number of filters are applied to these data. All of the Cal Poly data were
QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the
data from CDFW. Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and
staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data.

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from
the \href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project},
with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution. Reefs were
developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material
(``Reef Delineation''). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly
consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts
north of Point Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-depthfished-cpfvonboard}). The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are
outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger
areas considered as a factor in the index.

We retained 14218 drifts for index standardization, with
5960 drifts encountering vermilion rockfish
(Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-cpfvonboard}).

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-region-cpfvonboard}, \ref{tab:tab-depth-cpfvonboard}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-cpfvonboard}.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour)
a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar
in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-cpfvonboard}).

A Lognormal model was
selected over a over a Gamma model for the positive observations by a \(\Delta AIC\) of 919.67, and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-cpfvonboard}). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits (Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-cpfvonboard}),
a main effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin
was fit for the binomial model and a main
effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin
was fit for the Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-cpfvonboard} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-cpfvonboard}). The binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the 58\% zeroes in the observed data
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-cpfvonboard}). The predicted marginal effects from
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-cpfvonboard} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-cpfvonboard}. The
final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-cpfvonboard})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-cpfvonboard}).
