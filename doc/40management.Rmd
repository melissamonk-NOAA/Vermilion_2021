# Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

Projections of OFL (mt), ABC (mt), age 10+ biomass (mt), spawning output (billions of eggs), and depletion (% of unfished spawning output) are shown for the default harvest control rule in Table 62. Catch estimates for 2021 and 2022 are based on GMT recommendations (M. Mandrup, CDFW; pers. comm.), with frog mt for commercial and frog mt for recreational fleets. Projections assume a constant allocation among fleets equal to the recommended catch for 2021 and 2022 (frog% commercial, frog% commercial).
