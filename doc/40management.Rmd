# Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

**This section will be completed after the STAR panel**
<!--
Projections of OFL (mt), ABC (mt), age 10+ biomass (mt), spawning output (billions of eggs), and depletion (% of unfished spawning output) are shown for the default harvest control rule in Table 62. Catch estimates for 2021 and 2022 are based on GMT recommendations (M. Mandrup, CDFW; pers. comm.), with frog mt for commercial and frog mt for recreational fleets. Projections assume a constant allocation among fleets equal to the recommended catch for 2021 and 2022 (frog% commercial, frog% commercial).

## Regional Management and Spatial Management Considerations

Over the last several decades, spatially explicit management measures at both the state and federal/management council level have been implemented to achieve a wide range of marine resource and fishery management objectives. Depth restrictions to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) and the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) are key among those, as are the suite of total and partial exclusion of commercial and recreational fishing activities in the California statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). While the former are associated with explicit fisheries management objectives, the latter have a suite of ecological and economic objectives, most of which are not specific to, nor integrated across, the fisheries management arena. Despite this, both types of spatial management measures are expected to result in various biological, ecological, and socioeconomic effects within and adjacent to their boundaries.  All of these effects have the potential to influence the nature and quality of the data used to inform stock assessments of species that reside in these areas, including vermilion rockfish.

Regardless of the management objective, spatial closures are expected to increase the spatial heterogeneity in abundance and size or age structure of fished stocks. This greater spatial variability can complicate the assumptions made in stock assessment models, particularly the assumption that the densities and demographic structure of assessed populations are relatively homogeneous, at least across predictable habitat types such as bathymetric gradients or substrate types [@Punt2004; @Field2006; @Berger2017].  Although a wide range of factors above and beyond spatial management measures can also lead to violations of those assumptions, and the challenge is intuitively less problematic for populations with high movement rates and/or high population turnover, the challenge can be particularly important for longer lived populations with lower movement rates.  The challenge can best be summarized by the result that the more effective MPAs or other closed areas are at protecting populations within them, the more likely it is that traditional assessment approaches will be biased or more uncertain.  

If the spatial closures also prevent fisheries independent surveys from evaluating the relative abundance and demographic structure of managed populations, the challenges in developing robust population models, and thus robust management advice, become even more severe.  While spatially explicit assessment models provide a means of more explicitly addressing these challenges, such models are computationally intensive, require robust data from the specific areas being modeled, and may also require detailed information regarding movement and dispersal rates [@McGilliard2015; @Berger2017; @Punt2020; @Cadrin2020].  Moreover, the complexity of these spatial models increases substantially if the size and location of closed areas changes over time, as many of the more “fisheries management based” closures (e.g., RCAs) have in California groundfish fisheries.  Thus, such approaches may be less feasible for more data limited stocks, such as northern and southern vermilion rockfish, at least in the near term.  However, the fact that both the northern and southern assessment models are informed by fishery-independent surveys that include habitats both inside and outside area closures provides some hope for greater recognition of spatial factors in future assessments.  



# Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties
We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

- Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the 
vermilion/sunset complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within 
a single species and also between the two species.  Little biological data for south of 
Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed 
to better under biological parameters. 
  + Conduct life history studies
  + Conduct research to identify the proportion of each species in population and in catches

- Take a closer look at historical catch reconstructions and 
all other historical data sources.

- Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including 
a hierarchical structure and random effects. The CCFRP survey is the only 
fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky 
reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available, 
and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored 
since 2007.

- Continue to investigate the most appropriate model structure for the NWFSC HL survey index.
The NWFSC HL survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat 
in the Southern California Bight. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey index given its expansion into the CCA, also independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey.Increased spatiotemporal sampling around Pt. Conception would aid in identifying stock boundaries.

- Utilize existing ROV survey data sources
  + SWFSC Submersible Survey of the Cowcod Conservation Areas [@Yoklavich2007]. 
  +  This was a line-transect survey designed to estimate cowcod abundance in 2002 
  conducted from a submersible inside the CCAs.  Originally, only cowcod were enumerated from the video footage.  Over the last few years, the SWFSC has re-analyzed the video footage to enumerate other rockfish species. 
    + The SWFSC Fishery Resource Division (FRD) conducted a survey of potential cowcod habitat between Point Conception and the U.S. – Mexico border from October through December of 2012 [@Stierhoff2013].
    +  SWFSC staff are submitting proposals to conduct an additional submersible survey in the southern California Bight
    + CDFW ROV survey data


- Collection of length and age data are recommended for both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries.  Very little age data are available from either fishery for 
vermilion and sunset rockfishes.

- Investigate possible environmental drivers/co-variates for biological parameters, 
particularly for recruitment.

- Resolve differences between CalCOM and PacFIN expanded length composition data sets.
