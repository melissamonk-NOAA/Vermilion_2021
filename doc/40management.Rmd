# Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

**This section will be completed after the STAR panel**
<!--
Projections of OFL (mt), ABC (mt), age 10+ biomass (mt), spawning output (billions of eggs), and depletion (% of unfished spawning output) are shown for the default harvest control rule in Table 62. Catch estimates for 2021 and 2022 are based on GMT recommendations (M. Mandrup, CDFW; pers. comm.), with frog mt for commercial and frog mt for recreational fleets. Projections assume a constant allocation among fleets equal to the recommended catch for 2021 and 2022 (frog% commercial, frog% commercial).

# Regional Management Considerations
The state of California implements regional management for the recreational fleet in 
the form of five regions, referred to as management areas with differing depth and season 
restrictions. Until there is additional information on the distribution, life history 
differences between sunset and vermilion rockfishes, the current regional management 
framework is appropriate. The results from the ongoing SK grant exploring vermilion and sunset rockfish genetics will provide a more appropriate. HOwever, given the difficulty of differentiating 
the cryptic species pair without genetic identification, it is not feasible to separate landings 
of the two species.


# Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties
We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

- Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the 
vermilion/sunset complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within 
a single species and also between the two species.  Little biological data for south of 
Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed 
to better under biological parameters. 
  + Conduct life history studies
  + Conduct research to identify the proportion of each species in population and in catches

- Take a closer look at the Ralston historical catch reconstruction (\cite{Ralston2010}) and 
all other historical data sources.

- Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including 
a hierarchical structure and random effects. The CCFRP survey is the only 
fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky 
reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available, 
and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored 
since 2007.

- Continue to investigate the most appropriate model structure for the NWFSC HL survey index.
The NWFSC HL survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat 
in the Southern California Bight. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey index given its expansion into the CCA, also independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey.Increased spatiotemporal sampling around Pt. Conception would aid in identifing stock boundaries.

- Utilize existing ROV survey data sources
  + SWFSC Submersible Survey of the Cowcod Conservation Areas [@Yoklavich2007]. 
  +  This was a line-transect survey designed to estimate cowcod abundance in 2002 
  conducted from a submersible inside the \gls{cca}.  Originally, only cowcod were enumerated from the video footage.  Over the last few years, the SWFSC has re-analyzed the video footage to enumerate other rockfish species. 
    + The SWFSC Fishery Resource Division (FRD) conducted a survey of potential cowcod habitat between Point Conception and the U.S. â€“ Mexico border from October through December of 2012 [@Stierhoff2013].
    +  SWFSC staff are submitting proposals to conduct an additional submirsible survey in the southern California Bight
    + CDFW ROV survey data


- Collection of length and age data are recommended for both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries.  Very little age data are available from either fishery for 
vermilion and sunset rockfishes.

- Investigate possible environmental drivers/co-variates for biological parameters, 
particularly for recruitment.

- Resolve differences between CalCOM and PacFIN expanded length composition data sets.
