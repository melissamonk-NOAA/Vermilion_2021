\#\#\#Commercial Landings and Discards

\emph{Commercial Landings Prior to 1916}

For landings estimates prior to 1916, we based our reconstruction on the total rockfish catches reported in a summary of early California fisheries landings by Sette and Fielder {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1927)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the years 1888, 1892, 1895, 1899, 1904, 1908 and 1915. No rockfish were reported for 1888, thus we assumed no catches for that year and interpolated the catches between 0 and the 1892 catches (total of 834 tons) reported. Similarly, catches between the reported years were interpolated assuming a straight linear trend between the years reported. We used a ratio-estimator derived from the catch reconstruction fraction of vermillion rockfish in total rockfish landings for the 1916 to 1919 period (the ratio for a comparable five year period was nearly identical). We apportioned the catches north and south of Point Conception based on ratio estimators that used the same assumptions used to apportion catches in the reconstruction time period (1916-1968). The catch reconstruction estimates indicated that vermillion made up slightly under 1\% of the total rockfish catches during the early (1916-1919) time period, although the estimates indicate a slightly larger fraction (1.5\%) of total catches south of Conception relative to the fraction of total catches to the north (0.9\%). However, it is likely that the reconstruction is overestimating the fraction of smaller and/or more deeply distributed species relative to larger, shallower species as the reconstruction is based on the species composition data collected from market category samples in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The fishery has been shown to have progressed over time from a shallower, more nearshore distribution of effort to one in which deeper and more offshore waters were targeted {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Miller2014?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The notion that vermillion catches may have been greater is also consistent with the recognition by Roedel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1948)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} that during the 1930s and 1940s vermillion were ``One of the more important commercial species, it is one of three leading species in Southern California.'' However, by the time of that report, vermillion represented 5 to 8\% of the southern California catch (based on Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Ralston2010?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), much more than at the beginning of the time series. Future efforts to improve historical catch reconstructions by accounting for the shift in effort over time to deeper waters should continue to be flagged as a research need.

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{bradburn\_2003\_2011?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{weinberg\_2001\_2002?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Since 2007, the \Gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \Gls{mpa}s and understand nearshore fish populations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wendt and Starr 2009; Starr et al. 2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California (Año Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas) to include the entire California coast. Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \Gls{cpfv}s guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location: Humboldt State University; Bodega Marine Laboratories; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of California, Santa Barbara; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \Gls{mpa}s. Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth; since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V \emph{Miller Freeman}. Partial survey coverage of the US west coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \ref{fig:fig-reader1reader2}). Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described above. The same readers aged otoliths for both vermilion rockfish stock assessmetnt models. Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts (CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson, Stewart, and Punt 2012)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more experienced. The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} among the top three models was less than two. The best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard deviation for both readers.\\
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 selected the the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation (Figure \ref{fig:fit-oldfish}). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence internal using this model (Figure \ref{fig:fig-truereads}).\\
The latter model was selected for use in the assessment.

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT; {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\url{https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2018)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} functional regression model and is a commomly applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user.

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}; beta distribution with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\mu\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.72 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.15) is retained.

\#Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index of Abundance

\tagstructbegin{tag=H3}\tagmcbegin{tag=H3}

\hypertarget{deb-wilson-vandenberg-index}{%
\subsubsection{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index}\label{deb-wilson-vandenberg-index}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted by CDFW survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Reilly1998?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop. The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.

\textbf{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Monk2016?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop were recorded at a finer scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch information. Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the vessel is available. We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore excluded from the analysis (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-debwv}). Sampling targeted areas of central California. Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of those launched from port in District 6, which was removed from the analysis.

Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps and interpretation o hard bottom was extracted from the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes; Ft. Bragg to Santa Cruz (V1), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V2), San Luis Obispo to Pt. Conception (V3)", and Offshore (deeper) locations including the Farallon Islands and reefs of Half Moon Bay and Monterey Bay (V4). The ports in San Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and CPUE is also higher in this area (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-debwv})

We retained 6597 drifts for index standardization, with 2016 fishing location encountering vermilion.\\
Tables of the number of samples and positive observervations by factor can be found in Tables (\ref{tab:tab-depth-debwv}, \ref{tab:tab-region-debwv}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-debwv}).

\textbf{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

AA Gamma model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 5529.18 over a Lognormal model. The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-debwv}), a main effects model including YEAR and MegaReef and WAVE and DEPTH\_bin was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and MegaReef and WAVE and DEPTH\_bin was fit for the Gamma model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-debwv} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-debwv}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 69\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-debwv}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Gamma models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-debwv} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-debwv}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-debwv}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-debwv}).
