## Basic Information and Life History

Vermilion rockfish range from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to central Baja California at depths of 6 m to 436 m [@Love2002]. However, they are most commonly found from central Oregon to Punta Baja, Mexico [@Hyde2009] at depths of 50 m to 150 m [@Hyde2009].  Hyde and Vetter [-@Hyde2009] describe vermilion rockfish as residents of shallower depths (<100 m) than sunset rockfish. Adult fish tend to cluster on high relief rocky outcrops [@Love2002] and kelp forests [@Hyde2009]. North of Point Conception, some adults are shallower, living in caves and cracks [@Love2002]. Vermilion rockfish have shown high site fidelity [@Hannah2011 (only tagged 1 vermilion); @Lea1999], and low average larval dispersal distance [@Hyde2009]. Lowe et al. (2009) [Lowe2009] suggested vermilion rockfish to have a lower site fidelity than previously believed, but they acknowledged that their observations of movements to different depths may have been due to the reality of a shallower species and a deeper species. 
Approximate lifespan for vermilion rockfish is 60 years, with females living longer and growing larger than their male counterparts. 50% are mature at 5 years and about 37 cm, with males probably maturing at shorter lengths than females [@Love2002].

Vermilion rockfish are viviparous, and release 63,000 to 2,600,000 eggs per season. In southern California, vermilion rockfish larvae are released between July and March. In central and northern California, this release occurs in September, December, and April-June [@Love2002].  Larval release in fall and winter is not common among other rockfish species. Hyde and Vetter [-@Hyde2009] suggest that low larval dispersal may be due to weak poleward flow of nearshore waters corresponding with peak vermilion larval release. 

Young-of-the-year vermilion rockfish settle out of the plankton during two recruitment periods per year, first from February to April and a second from August to October, and settlement has been observed in May off southern California [@Love2002]. Larvae measure about 4.3 mm. Both young-of-the-year vermilion and sunset rockfish are mottled brown with areas of black, and older juveniles turn a mottled orange or red color [@Love2012a]. 
Juvenile fish are found individually from 6 m to 36 m, living near sand and structures. After two months, juveniles travel deeper and live on low relief rocky outcrops and other structures [@Love2002].

Adult vermilion rockfish predominantly eat smaller fish, though sometimes they pursue euphausiids and other various macroplankton [@Phillips1964]. Love [-@Love2002] noted their diet to include octopus, salps, shrimps, and pelagic red crabs. 


*Population Structure and Complex Assessment Considerations*

This assessment represents the cryptic species pair vermilion rockfish 
(*Sebastes miniatus*) and sunset rockfish (*Sebastes crocotulus*).
Hyde [-@Hyde2007] found seven mirochondrial and two nuclear genes analysis suggested 
three species within the subgenus *Rosicola*. Hyde et al. 
[-@Hyde2008b] described sunset rockfish as a distinct species noting depth separation 
of the adult populations of the two species using nine microsatellite loci. 
Sunset rockfish is distributed at depths 
greater than 50 fm (100 m) and are predominantly located south of Pt. Conception (\PtC). 
Hyde and Budrick identified speciation using mtDNA assay and size microsatelite loci, 
respectively.  The mtDNA analyses proved to be subject to introgression and mis-specification 
of sunset rockfish from mating between the two species post-divergence.
Additional population clusters of vermilion were found north of Pt. Conception, but neither 
study detected population structure between Half Moon Bay, California and Brookings, 
OR [@Hyde2009; @Budrick2016].

Vermilion and sunset rockfishes are morphologically very similar, with the most commonly 
cited differentiating feature being color. Hyde noted differences in three of six morphological 
parameters examined, but none of them can readily be used for field identification.

In all historical and current recreational and commercial catches, sunset and 
vermilion rockfish are both recorded as vermilion rockfish.  Future studies, 
such as the one described below will provide data needed to compare biological 
parameters between the two species as well as habitats.

_Ongoing Research (Provided by John Harms, NWFSC)_

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the Southern CA Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019.  Funding for this project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for FY 2020 through a proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.  

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed.  Some earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers.  However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from the vermilion genome into the sunset genome, a portion of the sunset rockfish population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals during the prior research project.  The current research has identified a robust suite of genetic markers within the nuclear genomes of the two species that definitively separates vermilion and sunset rockfish (including  introgressed sunset rockfish), canary rockfish, first generation vermilion-sunset hybrids, and identifies emerging patterns of intraspecific stock structure within the two sister species.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships, and other biological characteristics will be identified.  Using previously collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at 50% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared.  These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA work to  evaluate whether introgressed sunset rockfish represent a biologically intermediate subform of the species complex.  The effort also proposes to develop and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other information.  The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community.  If successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors, may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and management of cryptic species complexes.  Though this project will only focus on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.

THe northern model is bounded by the California/Oregon border and the southern model is bounded by the U.S./ Mexico border at the south (Figure \@ref(fig:assess-area)). Cape Mendocino (\CapeM) is also noted as it is a management boundary for the stock.
