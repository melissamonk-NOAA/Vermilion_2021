## Fishery-Independent Data

### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@Keller2017].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to 
a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes'
of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late 
May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel 
differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a 
relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large 
set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

Vermilion rockfish are strongly associated with rocky 
habitat, e.g., untrawlable habitat, but can be found over soft bottom, especially as 
juveniles.  This survey spans the entire West Coast and provided data for both the northern 
and southern California assessments.
 
**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* Vermilion rockfish are not found in high abundance in this survey, and in most 
cases lengths for the entire catch were availalbe, i.e., few enough individiuals were caught that 
all were measured. The assessment north of Point Conception includes 467 ages, which 
is almost of the vermilion rockfish with length (587 total) observed in this survey.
For south of Point Conception 1,283 of the 1,962 vermilion observed  and measured were also aged. 
The length composition and of vermilion from the WCGBT survey are in  Figure \@ref(fig:len-data-NWFSC-TWL). 

*Maturity samples.* Maturity samples were analyzed by by Melissa Head, NWFSC and a 
description of the results is in the section on biological data.

*Index of abundance.* The index was considered, but not used in the pre-STAR base model. Sample 
sizes of vermilion rockfish were low. A VAST model was attempted and did not converge 
for either the northern or southern California data and a VAST model that modeled the 
entire California coast assumed the same trends  in both areas.  The STAT also developed 
a delta-glm model for each area (north and south of Point Conception). Full details on the 
sample sizes of the observed data, the delta-generalized linear model explored and 
diagnostics, are in the Appendix.

### SWFSC Groundfish Ecology Cruises
D. Pearson (SWFSC, retired) conducted a series of groundfish surveys (hook-and-line and 
trawl) from 2003 - 2005 along the coast of California.  Surveys were conducted onboard 
chartered vessels and NOAA research vessels.

Even though samples were collected via multiple gear types, they were combined for use 
in the assessment.

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.*
A total of 229 vermilion were aged from this survey from samples in 2004-2005.
The length composition includes 355 vermilion from these surveys 
(Figures \@ref(fig:len-data-SWFSC-GF-ECOL)).


### J. Abrams thesis data

For his master's thesis work at Humboldt State University, Jeff Abrams conducted fishery-independent
hook-and-line surveys in 2010 and 2011 off of California's North Coast. Sites were randomly sampled from 
areas of known rocky habitat within six depth by distance-from-port strata out of three ports:
Crescent City Harbor, Trinidad Bay and Noyo River Harbor.  The otoliths collected as part of this 
study are valuable for nearshore groundfish stock assessments that are often lacking biological samples, 
especially from the North Coast. This collection resides at the SWFSC Santa Cruz lab. 

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* 
All 81 vermilion collected during the survey were aged and represent the most northern biological 
samples in this model. The available length composition in Figure
\@ref(fig:len-data-ABRAMS-RESEARCH). 


### California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project

Since 2007, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project (CCFRP)
has monitored several areas in California to 
evaluate the performance of \Gls{mpa}s and understand nearshore fish populations
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015]. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four 
\Gls{mpa}s in central California
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas)
to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \Gls{cpfv}s guided by one of 
the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location:
Humboldt State University;
Bodega Marine Laboratories;
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories;
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo;
University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within 
randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \Gls{mpa}s.
Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth;
since then, some have been retained for biological collections including otoliths and fin clips. 
This is the only long term fisheries-independent data series that spans the entire California 
coast and provides data on fish stocks within California's network of MPAs.

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* A total of 48 otoliths were available, but not included in the 
assessment model due to low 
annual sample sizes. The composition of length data from 4,344 vermilion encountered 
in the CCFRP survey is in Figure \@ref(fig:len_data_REC-CCFRP).

*Index of Abundance*
The index of abundance in the pre-STAR base model is a Bayesian negative binomial 
model, and the posterior predictions were weighted with the assumption that 20% of 
the available habitat within California state waters (0-3 nm) is within MPAs. 
The SWFSC has worked extensively on quantifying rocky habitat from high resolution
bahtymetric data collected as part of the Seafloor Mapping Program.  The quantification 
of habitat has been used in a number of stock assessments to weight indices of abundance 
since 2013.  This is the first time the habitat data are utilized to weight an inside/outside 
MPA effet within an index.  Full details on the observed data, model selection and modeling 
methods can be found in the Appendix.

### NWFSC Hook and Line Survey

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf 
rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations in the Southern California 
Bight. Key species of rockfish 
targeted by the survey are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), 
greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and 
*S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have 
been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously 
deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum 
of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the 
angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at 
each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers 
x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site 
selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@Harms2008]. 

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* This survey provides a wealth of biological information for the 
stock assessment, including lengths of 22,720 vermilion and ages from 9,211 vermilion. 
The length composition can be found in \@ref(fig:len-data-NWFSC-HKL).  


*Index of Abundance.*
The NWFSC hook-and-line survey has been used in a number of stock assessments.  Vermilion 
is one of the most common species encountered in the survey and also provides information 
on the stock inside the CCAs, which have been closed to fishing since 2002.  Detail on the 
index of abundance, samples sizes and model selection can be found in the Appendix.


### California Department of Fish and Wildlife CPFV Survey

The CDFW conducted a fishery-independent survey in the Southern California Bight 
from 1976-1989 aboard research vessels. The purpose of the survey related to groundifhs 
was to capture *Sebastes* specieds to determine composition (species, size and age) of 
fish and maturity in the Southern California Bight.  The whereabouts of the majority of the 
data from these cruises is unknown.  Bottom trawling in nearshore waters for juvenile 
rockfish was conducted, but those data are unavailable. 
This survey is also referred to as the 
"green binder" survey, as green binders were discovered containing data from these surveys. 
The SWFSC keypunched the available data and also houses the otolith collection from this study. 
It may be possible in the future to recover additional data from available cruise reports.

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.*
A total of 389 vermilion otoliths that were matched to available 
data from 1876-1977 and contained information on sex were aged for the assessment. 
A total of 1,442 lebths spanning 1976-1979 were also included (Figure 
\@ref(fig:len-data-CDFW-RESEARCH)).
