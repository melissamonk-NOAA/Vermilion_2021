### California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project

Since 2007, the \Gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to 
evaluate the performance of \Gls{mpa}s and understand nearshore fish populations
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015]. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four 
\Gls{mpa}s in central California
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas)
to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \Gls{cpfv}s guided by one of 
the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location:
Humboldt State University;
Bodega Marine Laboratories;
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories;
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo;
University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within 
randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \Gls{mpa}s.
Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth;
since then, some have been retained for biological collections including otoliths and fin clips.

**Available Data**

- Lengths (used)
- Ages (48 available, but not used due to low sample sizes)
- Index of abundance (for a detailed description of the index see frog)


### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@Keller2017].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to 
a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes'
of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late 
May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel 
differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a 
relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large 
set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

**Available Data**

- Conditional Age-at-Length (xx fish)
- Additional lengths of fish not aged
- Index of abundance (for a detailed description of the index see frog)
  + The index was considered, but not used in the pre-STAR base model. Sample 
  sizes of vermilion rockfish were low.



### NWFSC Hook and Line Survey

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf 
rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations in the Southern California 
Bight. Key species of rockfish 
targeted by the survey are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), 
greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and 
*S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have 
been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously 
deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum 
of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the 
angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at 
each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers 
x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site 
selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-Harms2008].

- Additional lengths of fish not aged
- Index of abundance (for a detailed description of the index see frog)
