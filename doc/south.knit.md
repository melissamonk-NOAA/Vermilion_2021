# Introduction

## Basic Information
This assessment reports the status of the 
Vermilion Rockfish (_Sebastes miniatus_) and Sunset Rockfish 
(_Sebastes crocotulus_) in U.S. waters off the coast of California south
  of Pt. Conception through 2020.

##Basic Information and Life History

*Population Structure and Complex Assessment Considerations*

Provided by John Harms (NWFSC)

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the Southern CA Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019.  Funding for this project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for FY 2020 through a proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.  

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed.  Some earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers.  However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from the vermilion genome into the sunset genome, a portion of the sunset rockfish population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals during the prior research project.  The current research has identified a robust suite of genetic markers within the nuclear genomes of the two species that definitively separates vermilion and sunset rockfish (including  introgressed sunset rockfish), canary rockfish, first generation vermilion-sunset hybrids, and identifies emerging patterns of intraspecific stock structure within the two sister species.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships, and other biological characteristics will be identified.  Using previously collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at 50\% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared.  These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA work to  evaluate whether introgressed sunset rockfish represent a biologically intermediate subform of the species complex.  The effort also proposes to develop and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other information.  The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community.  If successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors, may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and management of cryptic species complexes.  Though this project will only focus on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.

## Biological Data


### Length and Age Compositions

Differences in length compositions and length-at-age were explored 
north and south of Pt. Conception prior to any modelling. There are 
currently no available data to separate sunset and vermilion rockfishes.


Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

*North of Pt. Conception*

* Commercial sources
  + CALCOM (1978-2020)
* Recreational sources
  + Miller and Gotshall dockside survey (1959-1960)
  + CPFV samples from Commercial port samplers (1978-1979)
  + Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard observer survey (1988-1998)
  + MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)
  + CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2019)
* Fishery-independent surveys
  + CCFRP hook-and-line survey (2007-2018)
  + West Coast Groundfish Bottown Trawl Survey (2003-2019)



*South of Pt. Conception*

* Commercial sources
  + CALCOM (1978-2020)
* Recreational sources
  + Ally et al. onboard observer survey (1986-1989)
  + Collins and Crooke onboard observer survey (1975-1978)
  + MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)
  + CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2018)
* Fishery-independent surveys
  + NWFSC Hook-and-Line Survey (2004-2019)
  + West Coast Groundfish Bottown Trawl Survey (2003-2019)



The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time} and Table xxx. 
Descriptions and details of the length composition data are in the above section 
for each fleet or survey.

### Age Structures


**External Fits to Growth**


Fits to the von Bertalanffy growth curve, 
$L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in 
years, $k$ is rate of increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ 
is the asymptotic length, were explore by species and sex. 



### Ageing Precision and Bias

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish 
otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the 
SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \@ref(fig:reader1reader2)).
Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described 
above. The same readers aged otoliths for both vermilion rockfish stock assessmetnt models. 
Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read 
otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these 
two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts 
(CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software [@Thorson2012].
The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more 
experienced. The $\Delta AIC$ among the top three models was less than two. The 
best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard 
deviation for both readers.  
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 
selected the the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation 
(Figure \@ref(fig:oldfish)). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence 
internal using this model (Figure \@ref(fig:truereads)).  
The latter model was selected for use in the assessment. 
 

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings 
increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, 
the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.



### Maturation and Fecundity



### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT; https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel [-@Hamel2015] method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. [-@Then2018] functional regression model and is a commomly applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user. 




### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 


### Length-Weight Relationship

The length(cm)-weight(kg) relationship for vermilion rockfish was estimated outside the 
model using California biological data available from fishery-independent 
data sources. The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was $W$=1.744e-05$L$^3^ and males at $W$=1.744e-05$L$^3^ (Figure xx).



### Steepness

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.15) is retained.

# Appendix



### Califronia Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling 
program in 1999 [@Monk2014].  California Polytechnic State University (Cal 
Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling 
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows 
the protocols established in Reilly et al. [-@Reilly1998]. 

During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records 
location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset 
of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a 
maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather 
to a specific fishing location.  The sampler also records the starting and 
ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures 
discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter 
the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for vermilion. 
Cal Poly has modified protocols  reflect sampling changes that CDFW 
has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at 
the level of a fisher’s bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in 
the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019.  The only difference is that 
Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.  

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either 
CDFW or Cal Poly in 2020.

**California CPFV CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes**

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical 
in that the same protocols are followed.  The only difference is that Cal Poly
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained 
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index 
selectivity is mirrored to the recreational 
fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead) 
fish.  Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length 
from CDFW sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and indlucded in the 
length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model. 

A number of filters are applied to these data.  All of the Cal Poly data were 
QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the 
data from CDFW.  Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and 
staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data. 

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution.  Reefs were 
developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material 
("Reef Delineation"). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly 
consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts 
north of Pt. Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-depthfished-cpfvonboard). The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are 
outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger 
areas considered as a factor in the index.

We retained 14218 drifts for index standardization, with 
5960 drifts encountering vermilion 
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-cpfvonboard)).  

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-cpfvonboard), \@ref(tab:tab-depth-cpfvonboard), and \@ref(tab:tab-year-cpfvonboard).

**California CPFV CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics**

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) 
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not 
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-cpfvonboard)). 

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 919.67 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-cpfvonboard)). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-cpfvonboard)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-cpfvonboard)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-cpfvonboard)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 58%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-cpfvonboard)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-cpfvonboard) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-cpfvonboard)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-cpfvonboard)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-cpfvonboard)).

### CRFS Dockside Private Boat Index

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2018, 
were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number 
of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e. effort units are angler trips), 
angler-reported distance from shore, (Area.X: inside/outside of 3 nm, county, port, 
interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The sample size of the 
unfiltered private boat CPUE data is much larger than the crfspr CPFV data set, 
with 391,279 trips statewide, 120,655 in southern California (south 
of Point Conception), and 270,064 north of Point Conception. 

*CRFS Private Boat Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes*
Records were limited to “PR1” sites, and only the hook-and-line gear type 
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr). 
Since this is a dockside index lacking precise fishing location information, we 
use the percent of groundfish within the catch from a trip as a proxy for retaining 
trips for index standardization. Similar to the crfspr index, we partitioned the 
data into areas north and south of Point Conception and applied the method 
separately to each data set.

Since 2005, the recreational fishery for shelf rockfish north of Pt. Conception 
has been closed from January through part of April and May.Angler reported distance 
from shore had no samples in the “outside 3 nm” category (Area X = 2) 
from 2004-2011, but was retained in the index standardization due to the relaxation 
of depth restrictions beginning in 2017. We retained 12075 drifts for index standardization, with 6835 drifts encountering vermilion 
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr)).  


*Northern California CRFS Private Boat Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics*

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-crfspr) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-crfspr).
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) 
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not 
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-crfspr)). 

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 902.24 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-crfspr)). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-crfspr)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-crfspr)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-crfspr)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 43%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-crfspr)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-crfspr) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-crfspr)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-crfspr)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-crfspr)).

### MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index, 1980-1999

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of 
recreational CPFV fishing fleet. No MRFSS CPUE data are available for the years 
1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. Sampling of 
California CPFVs north of Point Conception was further delayed, and CPFV samples 
n 1993 and 1994 are limited to San Luis Obispo County. 
For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series was truncated at 1999 due 
to sampling overlap with the 
onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while 
onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for 
the same vessel). 

Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a 
single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a 
subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also 
identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers 
being interviewed.  The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. 
The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records 
belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).


**MRFSS CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes**

Trips recorded as having the primary area fished in Mexico or occurring in bays, e.g., 
San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition.
For indices representing only north of Pt. Conception, the years 1993-1994 were 
excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens2004] filtering approach was used to predict the 
probability of of catching vermilion, based 
on the species composition of the sampler observed catch in a given trip. Prior 
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative 
predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage 
(at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model.  The remaining 
24 all co-occurred with vermilion in at least one trip 
and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients 
from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive 
for species that are more likely to co-occur with vermilion, 
and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with vermilion 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sm-mrfss)).
The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with vermilion include
Copper, Greenspotted, Bocaccio, and Olive rockfishes and Ocean whitefish, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp 
habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were 
Kelp bass, Pacific bonito, White croaker, California sheephead, and Barred sandbass.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species 
assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of 
more than one species or species complex ("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch 
that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall 
[-@Stephens2004] recommended including all trips above a threshold where the 
false negatives and false positives are equally balanced.  However, this does 
not have any biological relevance and for this data set, we assume that if a 
vermilion was landed, the anglers had to have fished in appropriate habitat, 
especially given vermilion is strongly associated with rocky habitat.


The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence 
at which the rate of "false 
positives" equals "false negatives" of 0.31. The 
trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method 
including all the "false positive" trips, regardless of the probability of 
encountering vermilion. 
This assumes that if vermilion were caught, the anglers must have fished in 
appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is 
"sampler-examined" and the samplers are well trained in species identification.

Stephens and MacCall proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index 
standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives 
and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch 
a vermilion based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False 
negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a vermilion, given the 
catch composition, but caught at least one. The threshold probability that 
balances FP and FN excludes 
5383 
trips that did not catch a vermilion (84% 
of the trips), and 308 
trips (5% of the data) that 
caught a vermilion. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that 
catching a vermilion indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing 
effort occurred in habitat where vermilion occur. Only “true negatives” 
(the 5383 
trips that neither caught vermilion, nor were predicted to catch them by the model) 
were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included 
1043 trips, 70% 
of which encountered vermilion.  Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-mrfss) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-mrfss).



**MRFSS CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics**

Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be 
ill-fitting and the proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial 
models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that 
a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch 
per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. 
Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) 
and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore <3 nm, offshore >3 nm) 
factors were evaluated. Two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte 
to Santa Cruz ("N") and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo ("C") north of Pt. Conception. 
For models that span counties north and south of Pt. Conception, Santa Barbara to 
San Diego counties compose a third region ("S"). For models tha exclusively south 
of Pt. Conception, the region represent individual counties. Indices with a year 
and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average 
CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss)). 

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 51.8 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss)).  The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-mrfss)), 
a main effects model including 
NA 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and CNTY and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-mrfss)  and 
\@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-mrfss)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
proportion zeros similar to the 
30% 
zeroes in the observed data (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-mrfss)). 
The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models 
can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-mrfss) and 
\@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-mrfss)). The final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-mrfss)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-mrfss)).
