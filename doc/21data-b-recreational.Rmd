*Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003*

MRFSS estimates of California recreational landings from 1980-1989 and 1993-2003  
were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network 
([RecFIN](https://www.recfin.org/)). The MRFSS survey design included stratification by 
species (sunset rockfish were not recognized at the time), subregion (northern 
and southern California), 2-month ‘wave’, water area (e.g. within or beyond 
three miles from shore), and fishing mode (party/charter (PC) and private/rental (PR) boats,
plus various shore modes).  The PC mode includes the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel 
fleet (CPFV).

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) missing estimates of catch 
in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, 2) a change in the 
spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, and 3) a hiatus in 
sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode 
north of Point Conception. The STAT attempted to address each of these issues, 
as described below. CRFS estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS 
analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are 
included in the MRFSS catch estimate tables.

The MRFSS estimated catch in numbers of fish and converted these to catch in 
weight using estimates of average fish weight [kg] from the same stratum. When 
a stratum contained an estimate of catch in numbers but was missing an average 
weight, the estimate of catch in weight for that stratum was omitted (or sometimes 
assigned a zero value) in the database. To correct these errors, the STAT first 
identified strata with positive catch in numbers but missing or zero values for 
catch in weight. Catch in weight for these strata was then estimated by imputing 
a value of average weight based on the mean of the reported average weights in 
the same year and subregion. These factors had a greater influence on average 
weight than boat mode (Figure  frog EJ). The effect of this correction was relatively 
minor for vermilion rockfish overall (~1% increase in total catch by weight, 
1980-2004). However, 70% of missing catch in weight occurred over the years 
2001-2004, with differences in individual year/mode/subregion combinations sometimes exceeding 10-20%.

MRFSS catch estimates for California were spatially stratified into two subregions, 
“Southern California” (subregion 1) and “Northern California” (subregion 2). 
During the 1990-1992 statewide hiatus in sampling, the definitions of these two 
subregions changed. Specifically, San Luis Obispo (SLO) County was included in 
the southern region prior to the hiatus (i.e. 1980-1989) [@Witzig1992; @Karpov1995], 
but moved to the northern subregion starting in 1993. In order to create a 
definition of spatial strata that is consistent and comparable over time, and 
one that is consistently divided near Point Conception, the STAT examined catch 
estimates from a separate study [@Albin1993] that used a finer spatial 
resolution in the northern subregion (including SLO County). Over the period 
1981-1986, the amount of vermilion rockfish landed in SLO County was found to 
be roughly equal to the amount of vermilion rockfish landed in all California 
counties north of SLO County (Table frog EJ). Therefore, to approximate catches north
and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the ‘southern’ 
subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by an amount 
equal to the northern subregion catch during the same period, and doubled the 
northern subregion catch. On average, this ‘moves’ the estimated SLO County 
catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating 
a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series.


As noted above, MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues. 
The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the PC boat 
mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County.  To 
produce catch estimates for the missing subregion/mode/year combinations, we 
used linear interpolation. Shore modes were a minor component of the vermilion 
catch and therefore combined with catches from the private (PR) boat mode into 
a single fleet. Specifically, catches were aggregated by subregion (adjusted as 
described above), year, and mode, and endpoints for the interpolations were 
defined as 2-year averages to reduce the effects of interannual variability 
in catch on interpolated estimates.

MRFSS estimates of catch and discard after adjustment for missing average weights,
changes in subregion definition, and sampling gaps are shown in Table \@ref(tab:landings).

*California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2020*

Estimates of recreational landings and discard since 2004 have been produced by 
the CRFS. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, with higher 
sampling rates and finer spatial and temporal resolution.
Mortality estimates for the period 2005-2018 were queried from [RecFIN](www.recfin.org). 
Reported estimates are for southern California, all modes, and filtered to exclude fish 
caught in Mexican waters. Total recreational mortality estimates provided to RecFIN are 
also adjusted using species- and depth-specific discard mortality rates.

*Discard mortality rates*  
The recreational discard mortality rates for vermilion that were endorsed by the 
SSC and adopted by the 
PFMC in March 2017 are 20% for 0-10 fm, 34% for 10-20 fm, 50% for 20-30 fm, and 
100% for greater than 30 fm.


*Recreational length composition data*

Length compositions were provided from the following sources:


```{asis, echo = model.area == 'NCA'}
There are no available recreational length composition data available for 2020 north 
of Point Conception in RecFIN and sparse sampling was confirmed by J. Budrick (CDFW, pers. comm,).

*Recreational age composition data*

There are no recreational age composition data available for `r spp` from state sampling 
programs.
```{asis, echo = model.area=='NCA'}
Otoliths are available from collaborative with Cal Poly to investigate 
the precision of back-calculating whole fish length from filleted fish in the CPFV fleet. 
These otoliths were not aged for this assessment. 
```

*Recreational indices of abundance*

A number of indices of abundance were explore for the recreational fleet.  These include
the MRFSS era dockside survey of the PC fleet.  This represents sampler-examined retained 
catch. There are three sources of data for onboard observer coverage of the CPFV fleet: Deb 
Wilson Vandenberg's onboard observer survey from 1987-1989 that focused efforts in central California (although 
ports in northern California were sampled), the CDFW and pre-CRFS and CRFS era survey from 1999-2019 that 
distributes sampling coverage based upon landings and covers the entire coast from, and the 
Cal Poly program from 2001-2019 vessels fishing out of SLO county ports.  There are no onboard 
observer data available for 2020 due to COVID-19. All of these surveys represent retained catch 
in the vermilion assessment.  Discard catch is available from onboard observer surveys, but was not
included in indices.  The STAT considered developing separate indices for discards, but sample sizes 
were not large enough to warrant modeling.

An index representing the PR fleet from the primary intercept sampling sites was developed for 2004-2018. 
This index represents sampler-examined retained catch only.

The CDFW CPFV logbook data were not considered as an index of abundance due to the fact that 
vermilion may not be reported to the species level.
