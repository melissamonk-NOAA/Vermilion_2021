This assessment reports the combined status of the vermilion rockfish (\emph{Sebastes miniatus}) and sunset rockfish (\emph{Sebastes crocotulus}), referred to as ``vermilion rockfish'' throughout this document, in U.S. waters off the coast of California south of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) using data through 2020. Genetic evidence suggests overlapping distributions for the two species, with the majority of the sunset rockfish population occupying waters south of Point Conception. Alternative spatial structures for the vermilion rockfish assessment should be considered if additional data on stock structure and the distribution of the two species become available.

Over the past decade, vermilion rockfish in the assessed area off the coast of California have been primarily caught by the recreational fishery (Table \ref{tab:removalsES}). Annual total mortality of catch and discards of vermilion rockfish have ranged between 106-260 mt, with total mortality (catch + discards) in 2020 of 110 mt. Vermilion and sunset rockfish landings from all sectors have historically been recorded as ``vermilion rockfish'' and sampling programs in California currently do not differentiate between the two species.

Recreational removals in California prior to 2004 were only estimated at large spatial scales (north and south of Point Conception) following the design of the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS). Recent sampling (2004 -- present) by the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) produces estimates of vermilion rockfish landings and discard at a finer spatial resolution. Total removals south of Point Conception increased steadily following World War II, peaking in the late 1970s and 1980s with annual removals of 402 mt per year (Figure \ref{fig:catchES}). Recent years have seen a steady increase in landings, with recreational fleets accounting for the majority of total mortality.

A full assessment was attempted in 2005, but not accepted for management and a data-moderate assessment in 2013 was not reviewed. As such, this is the first benchmark assessment for vermilion and sunset rockfish. The 2021 assessment uses Stock Synthesis 3 (version V3.30.17.0). The assessment is a two-sex model, with the population spanning from the U.S./Mexico border to Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). The model operates on an annual time step covering the period 1875 to 2020 (not including forecast years) and assumes an unfished population prior to 1875. Population dynamics are modeled for ages 0 through 70, with age-70 being the accumulator age.

The model is conditioned on catch from two sectors (commercial and recreational) divided among seven fleets, and is informed by four abundance indices (one fishery-independent survey, two CPUE indices from shore-based sampling programs, and one CPUE index using onboard party/charter observer data). The model is also fit to length composition data from fishery-independent and fishery-dependent sources, as well as age compositions conditioned on length. Discards for the commercial fleets are not included in the model. Commercial discards of vermilion rockfish are a small fraction of the total mortality and data on commercial discard length composition is limited. The recreational fishery is split into four fleets, one discard and one retained fish fleet each for the private/rental and the party/charter boat modes. The model also incorporates an updated length-weight relationship, length-based maturity schedule, and fecundity-at-length function.

The assessment estimates a single natural mortality rate for females and males, steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, and sex-specific growth parameters. Year class strength is estimated as deviations from a Beverton-Holt expected stock-recruitment relationship beginning in 1965.

Spawning output of vermilion rockfish was estimated to be 471 million eggs in 2021 (95\% asymptotic interval: 229 - 714 million eggs) or 48\% (95\% asymptotic interval: 26\% - 71\%) of unfished spawning output (``depletion,'' Table \ref{tab:ssbES}). Depletion is a ratio of the estimated spawning output in a particular year relative to estimated unfished, equilibrium spawning output.

In southern California, spawning output declined rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s, likely falling below the minimum stock size threshold in the early 1990s, followed by a steady recovery since the early 2000s (Figures \ref{fig:ssbES} and \ref{fig:deplES}). The point estimate for spawning output in 2021 is above the management target (40\% of unfished spawning output).

Major recruitments (strong year classes) in southern California were consistently estimated by both primary sources of age data (NWFSC hook-and-line and trawl surveys), with a strong 1999 year class estimated even when either data set was removed (see sensitivity section) (Figure \ref{fig:recruitsES}). Other years with relatively high estimates of recruitment were 1983-84, 1999, and 2016. These are consistent with estimates of strong year classes in other rockfish stock assessments. Recent recruitments (2011-2020) have been above average in most years that are well-informed by data (Table \ref{tab:recrES}), although extended periods of below-average recruitment (e.g.~2001-2006) have also occurred and future trends in recruitment are highly uncertain.

The annual (equilibrium) spawning potential ratio (SPR) for vermilion rockfish in southern California has fluctuated around the management target for the past decade, with a recent spike in 2019 (Table \ref{tab:exploitES}, Figure \ref{fig:1-sprES}). Prior to 2011, the fishing intensity exceeded the target for a number of years in the 1980s and 1990s, regularly reaching levels 50\% above target (Figure \ref{fig:1-sprES}). As with current estimates of spawning output, recent estimates of equilibrium SPR are highly uncertain, ranging from 45\% to 104\% of target in 2020, and 102\% to 172\% of target in 2019 (Table \ref{tab:exploitES}). As a percentage of biomass (ages 4+), southern California harvest rates peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, but have since declined to near-target levels for the past decade (Figure \ref{fig:FmortalityES}). Harvest rates in southern California in 2020 were below target, and the stock was above the target biomass (Figure \ref{fig:phaseES}). However, the harvest rate in 2019 was above target, and may be more representative of future catches, all else equal, given reductions in fishing activity during the 2020 pandemic. The equilibrium yield curve is shifted left, as expected from the Beverton-Holt steepness parameter estimated at 0.73 (Figure \ref{fig:yield2ES}).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Ecosystem Considerations}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in analyses. This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

Vermilion/sunset rockfish are described as feeding on a wide range of both pelagic and benthic prey items, including forage fish species such as anchovies and mesopelagic fishes, squid, krill and octopus, as well as sporadically abundant pelagic organisms such as pyrosomes, salps and pelagic red crabs.

As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment, or cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for the vermilion/sunset rockfish complex, with only a modest apparent relationship to estimated levels of spawning output. Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements of California Current food webs. With additional research, it may be feasible to incorporate ecosystem factors using results of pre-recruit surveys for co-occurring species or results from more data-rich groundfish assessments Such approaches would require more development and evaluation. Consequently, environmental factors are not explicitly considered in this assessment.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Reference point and management quantities for the vermilion rockfish base case model can be found in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. In 2021, spawning output relative to unfished spawning output (``depletion'') is estimated at 48\% (95\% asymptotic interval: 26\% - 71\%). This stock assessment estimates that vermilion rockfish in the south is above the biomass target ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), and well above the minimum stock size threshold ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{25\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). Unfished age four-plus biomass is estimated to be 6011 mt in the base case model (95\% asymptotic interval: 4805 - 7217 mt). The target spawning output ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) is 391 million eggs (95\% asymptotic interval: 311 - 471 million eggs). Equilibrium yield at the proxy {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(F_{MSY}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} harvest rate corresponding to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is 148 mt (95\% asymptotic interval: 121 - 176 mt, Table \ref{tab:referenceES} and Figure \ref{fig:yield2ES}).

Vermilion rockfish have been managed as part of the minor shelf rockfish complex in the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. North of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$, total mortality of the minor shelf rockfish complex has exceeded the OFL since 2011. South of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$, total mortality of the minor shelf rockfish complex has exceeded the OFL since 2015, and exceeded the ABC in most years since 2011. Total mortality estimates from the NWFSC are not yet available for 2020. A summary of these values as well as other base case summary results can be found in Tables \ref{tab:managementES} and \ref{tab:summaryES}.

Results from post-STAR base models in all areas (southern California, northern California, Oregon, and Washington) are presented in Table \ref{tab:CombinedRefPtsES}. The fraction of the northern California model allocated to the northern management area (north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$) is based on an Appendix in northern California assessment.

The stratification of assessment areas was based on consideration of population structure identified in genetic analyses, differences in historical exploitation, differences in length composition within fleets, and availability of data sources. The STAR Panel discussed the potential for alternative stratifications such as north and south of Cape Mendocino depending on the results of future analyses of population structure.

Natural mortality remains the primary axis of uncertainty across assessment areas. Additional collection of otoliths from across the range of the stock and continued ageing of available otoliths may help reduce uncertainty in the future. In the relatively data-rich southern California model, steepness was estimated and uncertainties in both natural mortality and steepness were considered when determining alternative states of nature.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the post-STAR base model, with the forecast projections presented in Table \ref{tab:projectionES}. The total catches in 2021 and 2022 are set to the projected catch from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) by sector and model region, i.e., allocated north and south of $34^\circ 27^\prime N$ in California.

Uncertainty in the decision table forecasts is based upon the three alternative states of nature agreed upon during the STAR panel, reflecting results of a bivariate likelihood profile over natural mortality and steepness. The low state of nature assumes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = .1125 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.675, and the high state of nature assumes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.1475 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.875.

The buffers between OFL and ABC were calculated assuming a category 2 stock, with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 1.0 and a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45. For reference, the base model predicted {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is 0.258, calculated using the asymptotic standard error of the predicted OFL in 2021. Alternative catch streams (rows in the table) include {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 1.0 with a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.4, and removals of long-term equilibrium catch at the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(F_{SPR=50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} harvest rate with and without a buffer assuming {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 1.0 and a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45. The buffer multiplier with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45 ranges from 0.874 in 2023 ramping to 0.803 in 2032.

The base model with the default harvest control rule catches (p*=0.45, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=1) predicts an increasing stock over the period from 2023-2032. Forecasts based on the alternative catch streams project that the stock will remain above the target threshold of 40\% through 2032 given either the base model or ``high'' states of nature (Table \ref{tab:DecisionES}). Given the low state of nature, the stock remains below the target threshold of 40\% throughout the 12-year forecast under all four catch scenarios.

The STAT cautions that the GMT projections for catches in 2021-2022 (210 mt per year) exceed the maximum sustainable yield according to both proxies ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(B_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) as well as the MSY value based on the estimated value of steepness (Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). The southern California stock is above target biomass, so the GMT catch levels are unlikely to result in significant stock declines over a 2-year period. However, similar catch levels would exceed the overfishing limits (OFL) for 2023 and beyond (Table \ref{tab:projectionES}), and would be unsustainable in the long term. Given recent and projected near-term exploitation levels, and especially if vermilion and sunset rockfish continue to be managed as part of the minor shelf rockfish complex, the STAT recommends regular monitoring of total mortality for these two species to avoid excessive stock depletion and potential loss of yield.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The following are high priority research and data needs for this assessment. Additional details for each topic can be found in the full assessment.

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\tagstructbegin{tag=L}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Develop a coastwide hook-and-line survey to provide indices of abundance and associated biological sampling providing representative data in untrawlable habitats.
\item
  Examine the available tools more fully in cases when a survey's footprint is abruptly changed as a result of management action. These tools may include (but are not limited to), treating the ``new'' and ``old'' surveys as completely separate (aka breaking the survey), using selectivity blocks, or spatial/temporal modeling approaches. This avenue is important for many fishery-independent and -dependent indices, as they are subjected to numerous spatial management changes which in turn can affect the veracity of the data collected. Additional efforts are needed to investigate how fishery selectivity changes with management changes and how best to address the effects of management changes on length composition and indices.
\item
  Expansion of the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project into deeper depths outside and inside MPAs and to other closed areas to encompass the full depth distribution of vermilion and sunset rockfish or other shallow shelf rockfish species would provide valuable data for future assessments.
\item
  Conduct additional investigations to resolve uncertainties in historical catch reconstructions would improve estimates of the scale of assessments and provide more representative removal estimates.
\item
  Explore appropriate methods of including catches as numbers of fish vs.~biomass.
\item
  There is currently a very small amount of fishery-dependent age data collected in southern California such that none were included in the southern California stock assessment.
\item
  Continue the NWFSC hook-and-line survey, which is a very important and informative source of data for the southern California stock assessment. Additional research into methods to standardize the hook-and line survey.

Also, many current studies and data sets (e.g., landing statistics) do not distinguish between the species. In this document, we refer simply to ``vermilion rockfish'' when no species-specific information is available.}

Vermilion rockfish (\emph{Sebastes miniatus}) range from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to central Baja California at depths of 6 m to 436 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. However, they are most commonly found from central Oregon to Punta Baja, Mexico {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} at depths of 50 m to 150 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Hyde and Vetter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} describe vermilion rockfish as residents of shallower depths (\textless100 m) than their sibling species, sunset rockfish (\emph{Sebastes crocotulus}). Adult fish tend to cluster on high relief rocky outcrops {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and kelp forests {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. North of Point Conception, California, some adults reside in shallower water, living in caves and cracks {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Vermilion rockfish have shown high site fidelity {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hannah and Rankin 2011 (only tagged one vermilion rockfish), Lea et al. 1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and low to average larval dispersal distance {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Lowe et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} suggested that vermilion rockfish have a lower site fidelity than previously believed, but acknowledged that their observations of movements to different depths may have been due to differences in depth distribution between the species. Vermilion rockfish have been aged to over 80 years, but few fish have been aged above 60 years, with females growing larger than their male counterparts. Fifty percent of females are mature at 5 years and about 37 cm, with males likely maturing at shorter lengths than females {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Vermilion rockfish are viviparous, and females produce an estimated 63,000 to 2,600,000 eggs per brood, with larger fish releasing a substantially larger number of larvae. In southern California, vermilion rockfish larvae are released between July and March. In central and northern California, this release occurs in September, December, and April-June {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Hyde and Vetter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} suggest that low larval dispersal may be due to weak poleward flow of nearshore waters corresponding with peak vermilion rockfish larval release.

Young-of-the-year vermilion rockfish settle out of the water column during two primary recruitment periods per year, first from February to April and a second from August to October, and settlement has been observed in May off southern California {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Young-of-the-year vermilion and sunset rockfish are both mottled brown with areas of black, and older juveniles turn a mottled orange or red color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2012)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Larvae measure about 4.3 mm and juvenile fish are found in depths of 6-36 m, living near sand and structure. After two months, juveniles travel deeper and live on low relief rocky outcrops and other structures {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Adult vermilion rockfish predominantly eat smaller fish, though sometimes they pursue euphausiids and other various macroplankton {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Phillips 1964)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Love et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} noted their diet includes octopuses, salps, shrimps, and pelagic red crabs.

\emph{Population Structure and Multi-species Assessment Considerations}

This assessment represents the aggregate population dynamics of the cryptic species pair vermilion rockfish and sunset rockfish. Hyde {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} examined seven mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, which upon analysis suggested three species within the subgenus \emph{Rosicola}. Hyde et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} described sunset rockfish as a distinct species noting depth separation of the adult populations of the two species using nine microsatellite loci. Adult sunset rockfish are mainly distributed at depths greater than 50 fm (100 m) and are predominantly located south of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). Hyde and Vetter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and Budrick {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} identified species using mtDNA assays and microsatellite loci, respectively.

Vermilion and sunset rockfish are morphologically very similar, with color being the most commonly cited differentiating feature. Hyde and Vetter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} noted differences in three of six morphological parameters examined, but none of them can readily be used for field identification.

In all historical and current recreational and commercial catches, sunset and vermilion rockfish are both recorded as vermilion rockfish. Future studies, such as the one described below will provide data needed to compare biological parameters between the two species as well as habitats and distributions.

\emph{Ongoing Population Structure Research (Provided by John Harms, NWFSC)}

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) Survey and the Southern California Shelf Rockfish Hook-and-Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019. Funding for this project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for fiscal year 2020 through a proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed. Some earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from the vermilion rockfish genome into the sunset rockfish genome (or incomplete lineage sorting), a portion of the sunset rockfish population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals during the prior research project.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships, and other biological characteristics will be identified. Using previously collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at 50\% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared. These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA work to evaluate whether introgressed (hybrid) sunset rockfish represent a biologically intermediate subform of the species complex. The effort also proposes to develop and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other information. The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community. If successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors, may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and management of cryptic species complexes. Though this project will only focus on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.

\subsection{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations-1}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors (other than as they inform relative abundance indices) or environmental factors into the assessment model, but a brief description of likely or potential ecosystem considerations are provided below.

Vermilion/sunset rockfish are described as feeding on a wide range of both pelagic and benthic prey items, including forage fish species such as anchovies and mesopelagic fishes, squid, krill and octopus, as well as sporadically abundant pelagic organisms such as pyrosomes, salps and pelagic red crabs {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Phillips 1964, Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Interestingly, other rockfishes (either juvenile or adult stages) have not been documented as prey for vermilion rockfish, as they have been for other large \emph{Sebastes} species such as cowcod, bocaccio, and yelloweye rockfish. For the latter species, the idea of ``cultivation effects,'' in which adults crop down forage species that are potential competitors/predators of their own juveniles {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Walters and Kitchell 2001)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, has been suggested by {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}Baskett et al. (2006)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. For example, Baskett et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2006)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} found that in such scenarios there could be alternative stable states in which either the overfished species or the smaller prey species could dominate. While the sparse diet data for vermilion/sunset rockfish do not suggest such a process for this species complex, food habits data for vermilion/sunset are not robust, and the larger community processes on these rocky reef communities may also influence productivity and community composition regardless of the direct predation interactions. Pelagic and benthic juvenile vermilion and sunset rockfish are likely preyed upon by the same wide range of predators that prey on juveniles and adults of other rockfish species, including seabirds, piscivorous fishes, and marine mammals.

As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment, or cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for the vermilion/sunset rockfish complex, with only a modest apparent relationship to estimated levels of spawning output. Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements of California Current food webs. Empirical estimates of recruitment from pelagic juvenile rockfish surveys have been used to inform incoming year class strength for some of these stocks, however vermilion/sunset rockfish are rarely encountered in these surveys. Specifically, only 47 of nearly 300,000 total juvenile \emph{Sebastes} encountered in juvenile surveys since 2001 were identified as vermilion/sunset rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Field et al. 2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Despite this, the results here suggest that at least a reasonable fraction of recruitment variability for sunset and vermilion rockfish is shared with other rockfish and groundfish stocks throughout the California Current, many of which also had strong year classes in 1984, 1999 and 2015-2016. Previous studies have demonstrated that large-scale oceanographic drivers, such as the relative transport of subarctic waters (typically indicated by relative sea level) tend to relate to a substantial fraction of overall groundfish recruitment trends and ecosystem productivity {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}Schroeder et al. (2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Although it is feasible that ecosystem factors, the results of pre-recruit surveys for co-occurring species, or the results of other groundfish assessments might ultimately be used to forecast recruitment for more data-limited stocks such as vermilion and sunset rockfish, as suggested by {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson and Ward 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, such approaches would require more development and evaluation. Consequently, environmental factors are not explicitly considered in this assessment.

\emph{Commercial Fishery}\\
The commercial groundfish fishery off California developed in the late 19th century and consisted mainly of hook and line gear types (Figure \ref{fig:catch}). At the end of the 19th century, total rockfish landings were estimated to be between 2,000 to 3,500 tons statewide, with slightly over half of the catch during this period coming from waters south of Point Conception, and most of the remaining catch from central California ports (particularly San Francisco and Monterey). Catches declined through the 1930s as a result of the rapid expansion of the California sardine fishery, which tended to be more profitable {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love et al. 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The rockfish trawl fishery rapidly expanded into California in the early 1940s, after the introduction of the `balloon trawl,' and when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Harry and Morgan 1961, Alverson et al. 1964, Lenarz 1987)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Trawl landings have been restricted in most of southern California for decades {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Frey 1971)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and trawl gear north of Point Conception has not recently been a major component of the landings for vermilion rockfish, with the highest reported landings in the 1970s. The commercial setnet fishery has never been a large component of the vermilion rockfish landings and has essentially been non-existent for vermilion rockfish since 2002 when the state of California prohibited setnet gear in 60 fm or less. The largest net landings for vermilion rockfish were in the 1980s.

Vermilion rockfish have been landed in the commercial live-fish fishery that developed off the coast of California in the 1990s, but have not been a major target of that fishery due to their susceptibility to barotrauma. The fraction of the total catch from the live fish fleet is small, concentrated in northern California, and included in the commercial hook-and-line fleet in the northern California assessment models. The STAT also learned that vermilion rockfish landed dead (due to barotrauma) from a commercial trip landing live fish, remain valuable and may be sold dead. Separation of catch and size compositions for the live and dead catch is therefore less informative and was not pursued further.

Miller et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} described the spatial and temporal development of the California commercial groundfish fishery based on historical CDFW fish ticket and block summary data. They analyzed a spatially-explicit database of landings in California dating back to 1933, finding that groundfish fishing effort has shifted from shallow, coastal areas to deeper depths, greater distances from port, and in areas of more inclement weather over time. That general result was also found with limited data from recreational fisheries. Sampling of commercial species compositions in Southern California began in 1983, a time when the groundfish fleet was already fishing in deeper depths. Both historical reconstructions used these data to represent species compositions of total rockfish catch during earlier periods of the fishery. As a result, the reconstructions may overestimate the percentage of deep-water species in earlier fisheries that operated closer to port and in shallower depths.

\emph{Recreational Fishery}\\
Vermilion rockfish are a targeted species in California's recreational fishery and have always ranked high in terms of catch among rockfish species, both in the party/charter boat and private/rental sectors. The Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV; aka `party' and `charter' boat) fleet began circa 1919 in California, although recreational fishing effort for fishes other than Tunas, other gamefish, and salmon was minimal until about 1930. The CPFV fleet numbered about 200 vessels in 1939 ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Croker 1940)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, cited in Young {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1969)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). After a hiatus in most operations during WWII, the fleet increased to about 590 vessels by 1953, then declined to approximately 256 vessels around 1963.

Onboard surveys of CPFV vessels in southern California ranked vermilion rockfish as the fifth and third most common rockfish species in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, respectively {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ally et al. 1991, Collins and Crooke n.d.)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Onboard CPFV observers in central California saw vermilion rockfish in over 27\% of all observed drifts over the period 1987-1998, making vermilion rockfish fifth among rockfish species in terms of encounter rates per drift {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Monk et al. 2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}

In southern California, harvest of vermilion rockfish from recreational fisheries, as a percentage of the total vermilion rockfish harvest, varied considerably from 1980 to 2000. After 2000, largely due to reduced commercial access to shelf habitat, recreational fisheries accounted for almost all the vermilion rockfish harvest in southern California, with relatively minor contributions from the commercial fleets. Similar patterns occurred north of Point Conception, with the majority of vermilion rockfish landings coming to ports in San Luis Obispo county.

\hypertarget{summary-of-management-history}{%
\subsection{Summary of Management History}\label{summary-of-management-history}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in 1982, vermilion rockfish were managed through a regulatory process that included the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) along with either the California State Legislature or the Fish and Game Commission (FGC) depending on the sector (recreation or commercial) and fishery. With implementation of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, vermilion rockfish came under the management authority of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), and were managed as part of the \emph{Sebastes} complex. Because neither species had undergone rigorous stock assessment and did not compose a large fraction of the landings they were classified and managed as part of ``Remaining Rockfish'' under the larger heading of ``Other Rockfish'' {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Pacific Fishery Management Council 2002, 2004)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Since the early 1980s a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access with specific regulations designed for each component. Other regulatory actions for the general rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions, and cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial sectors: limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl. Harvest guidelines are also used to regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and commercial sectors.

In 2000, changes in the PFMC's rockfish management structure resulted in the discontinued use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and was replaced with three species groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes (January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221). Vermilion rockfish are managed in aggregate with other species in the minor shelf rockfish group, which is further divided into management areas north and south of Cape Mendocino, California ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$).

Since the enactment of California's Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), the Pacific Fishery Management Council and state of California developed and adopted various management specifications including seasonal and area closures (e.g.~the CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, gear restrictions, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery. Commercial fisheries were regulated through the use of license and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal and area closures (e.g.~the RCAs and CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size limits {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wilson-Vandenberg et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\textbf{Management of Recreational Fisheries}

In March 1984 California adopted a general 20 aggregate daily bag limit that included a sub-bag limit of 10 fish for any given species. Significant regulatory changes in California's recreational sector began with a change from unlimited number of hooks and lines allowed prior to 2000 to no more than three hooks and one line per angler in 2000. Since 2001, the limit has been no more than two hooks and one line per angler and there is not a size limit on vermilion rockfish in the recreational fishery. Beginning January 1, 2021, the CDFW enacted a five-fish sub-bag limit for vermilion rockfish in the recreational fishery.

California also began spatial management, including area closures, and depth restrictions for the recreational fleet in 2000. In general, the recreational season north of Point Conception extends from April to December, and south of Point Conception from March to December. North of Point Conception vermilion rockfish in California are most commonly landed from Monterey to Morro Bay, where the maximum depth open to recreational fishing was between 30 and 40 fathoms until 2017. In 2017, the depth restrictions were eased by 10 fathoms, opening up 40-50 fm depths along the central California coast that had not been open consistently since 2002. In both 2017 and 2018, the deepest 10 fathoms was closed prior to the prescribed season in December due to high by-catch rates of yelloweye rockfish, which remains in an overfished status and is undergoing rebuilding. A full history of the recreational regulations relating to the spatial management of the fleet can be found in the Appendix.

\textbf{Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCA)} In 2001, two area closures {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36132\&inline}{``Cowcod Conservation Areas''}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were implemented to reduce fishing mortality of cowcod, originally prohibiting bottom-fishing deeper than 20 fm. Effective 2019, retention of nearshore and shelf rockfish (excluding cowcod) is allowed in depths shallower than 40 fm. The larger of the two areas (CCA West) is a 4200 square mile area west of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. A smaller area (CCA East) is about 40 miles offshore of San Diego, and covers about 100 square miles.

\textbf{Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCA)} In 2002 the PFMC established trawl- and non-trawl area closures known as the Rockfish Conservation Areas. These closed areas are gear-specific, and have seasonally changing boundaries to help reduce fishing mortality.

The contribution of vermilion rockfish to the minor shelf rockfish Overfishing Limit (OFL) is currently derived from the data-poor Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick and MacCall 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A 2005 vermilion rockfish stock assessment was not accepted for use in management and a 2013 data-moderate assessment was not reviewed by the STAR panel due to insufficient time.

Total mortality for vermilion rockfish was obtained from the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/api/v1/source/observer.gemm_fact/selection.xlsx}{GEMM}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} report {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Somers et al. 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The coastwide management of the shelf rockfish complex is split at Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$). Therefore, the northern California vermilion rockfish model contains a portion of the management area from Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$) to the California-Oregon border ($42^\circ 00^\prime N$). The southern California vermilion rockfish model contains the area within the southern management area (south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$) that is south of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$).

The total mortality of the shelf rockfish complex has been above the OFL in all years (2011-2019) north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$, and above the OFL south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ from 2015-2019. Total mortality estimates from the NMFS NWFSC are not yet available for 2020 (Table \ref{tab:managementES}). Vermilion rockfish total mortality was on average 59\% (range 55\%-66\%) of the total shelf rockfish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ total mortality from 2011-2016. Vermilion rockfish decreased from 21\% to 4\% of the total contribution to the shelf rockfish complex north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ from 2011-2019 with a noticeable decline from 16\% to 6\% from 2016 to 2017.

\emph{Commercial Landings Prior to 1916}

For landings estimates prior to 1916, we based our reconstruction on the total rockfish catches reported in a summary of early California fisheries landings by Sette and Fielder {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1927)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the years 1888, 1892, 1895, 1899, 1904, 1908 and 1915. No rockfish were reported for 1888. We assumed no catches prior to 1875 and interpolated the catches between 0 mt and the 1892 catches (total of 834 tons) as reported. Similarly, catches between the reported years were interpolated assuming a straight linear trend between the years reported. We used a ratio-estimator derived from the catch reconstruction fraction of vermililion rockfish rockfish in total rockfish landings for the 1916 to 1919 period (the ratio for a comparable five year period was nearly identical). We apportioned the catches north and south of Point Conception based on ratio estimators that used the same assumptions used to apportion catches in the reconstruction time period (1916-1968). The catch reconstruction estimates indicated that vermililion rockfish made up slightly under 1\% of the total rockfish catches during the early (1916-1919) time period, although the estimates indicate a slightly larger fraction (1.5\%) of total catches south of Point Conception relative to the fraction of total catches to the north (0.9\%). However, it is likely that the reconstruction is overestimating the fraction of smaller and/or more deeply distributed species relative to larger, shallower species as the reconstruction is based on the species composition data collected from market category samples in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The fishery has been shown to have progressed over time from a shallower, more nearshore distribution of effort to one in which deeper and more offshore waters were targeted {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The notion that vermililion rockfish catches may have been greater is also consistent with the recognition by Roedel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1948)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} that during the 1930s and 1940s vermililion rockfish were ``One of the more important commercial species, it is one of three leading species in southern California.'' However, by the time of that report, vermililion rockfish represented five to eight percent of the southern California catch, based on Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, much more than at the beginning of the time series. This uncertainty is investigated more deeply in the model uncertainty and sensitivity section. Future efforts to improve historical catch reconstructions by accounting for the shift in effort over time to deeper waters should continue to be flagged as a research need.

\emph{Commercial Landings, 1916-2020}

For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston and MacFarlane 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl,' and `unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were assigned to southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al.~includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports in San Luis Obispo County (north of Point Conception). To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-allocate}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data.

Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception, and either trawl or `non-trawl' gear types. Since hook-and-line gears catch the majority of commercially-caught vermilion rockfish, we assigned estimated catch in the `non-trawl' category to the hook and line fleet in the assessment model.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes. Since commercial port sampling south of Point Conception started later, ratio estimates were used in some southern California port complexes through 1983. See Appendix A of Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and Pearson et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}(pp.~8 and 15-16) for further details.

Commercial catches from 1978-present were pulled from the CALCOM database, which is stratified using an identical design as the pre-1978 data described above and ensured consistency of the port complex and gear groupings over the entire time series (1969-2020). Although available strata definitions within PacFIN do not match the design of the California commercial catch expansion {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Pearson and Erwin 1997)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, the STAT was able to manually aggregate data from PacFIN to almost exactly match the CALCOM estimates (Figure \ref{fig:calcom-pacfin}). The STAT recommends that port complex and gear group definitions used to expand California commercial catch estimates be incorporated into PacFIN lookup tables to facilitate future comparisons, ensure consistency between the two systems, and help identify potential errors.

\emph{Commercial length and age composition data}

Biological data (lengths) from the commercial fisheries that landed vermilion rockfish were extracted from CALCOM. The CALCOM length composition data were ``expanded'' (catch-weighted by stratum, then aggregated by region, gear group, and year) to better represent the size composition of the landed catch. The length composition is available in Figure \ref{fig:len-data-COM-HKL} for the commercial hook-and-line fleet, and Figure \ref{fig:len-data-COM-NET} for the commercial net fleet. Input sample sizes for commercial length compositions were based on the number of port samples and are in Tables \ref{tab:length-sample-size} and \ref{tab:length-inputN}. Length compositions with fewer than 30 measured fish in a region/gear/year combination were not included in the model likelihood.

Commercial discard length compositions from WCGOP were provided on 17 Nov 2020 by Andi Stephens (NWFSC). Only 224 vermililion rockfish were measured statewide from 2004-2018. The sparse discard length composition data were not considered for use in the model as discarded catch is a small fraction of the overall commercial landings.

Otoliths collected from commercial fisheries north of Point Conception were provided by the Pacific States Fisheries Commission and aged, but not used in the assessment due to low annual sample sizes.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\emph{Recreational Landings, 1928-1980}

Recreational catch estimates prior to 1981 were based on the Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} catch reconstruction, which estimated catches by mode (CPFV and private vessel modes, where the latter included any shore-based catches) and estimated catches separately north and south of Point Conception. Party/Charter (PC mode) catches of all rockfish were based on logbook data (which do not report rockfish to the species level), scaled by compliance estimates, while total recreational catches from private/rental vessels (PR mode) catches were based on a combination of the relative catch rates observed in the PC fleet and a linear ramp between catch estimates in the early 1960s and those in the early 1980s (as described in Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The species composition of rockfish catches was estimated using a combination of the 1980s MRFS data as well as limited PC mode species composition data from onboard observer programs in the late 1970s (south of Point Conception) and dockside recreational creel surveys in the late 1950s and early 1960s (north of Point Conception). Vermilion (and sunset) rockfish have long been recognized as an important target of recreational fishers south of Point Conception, as well as those in the Morro Bay region, although they are less frequently encountered in recreational fisheries further north. As noted in Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} the catch reconstruction effort was intended to be an ``iterative and multistage process,'' and there is considerable room for improvements in both the commercial and the recreational catch reconstruction estimates.

\emph{Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003}

MRFSS estimates of California recreational landings from 1980-1989 and 1993-2003 were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://www.recfin.org/}{RecFIN}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The MRFSS survey design included stratification by species (sunset rockfish were not recognized at the time), subregion (northern and southern California), 2-month `wave,' water area (e.g.~within or beyond three miles from shore), and fishing mode (party/charter (PC) and private/rental (PR) boats, plus various shore modes). The PC mode includes the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel fleet (CPFV).

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) missing or imprecise estimates of catch in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, 2) a change in the spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, and 3) a hiatus in sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode north of Point Conception. The STAT attempted to address each of these issues, as described below. CRFS estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are included with the MRFSS catch estimate tables.

The MRFSS estimated catch in numbers of fish and converted these to catch in weight using estimates of average fish weight {[}kg{]} from the same stratum. When a stratum contained an estimate of catch in numbers but was missing an average weight, the estimate of catch in weight for that stratum was omitted (or sometimes assigned a zero value) in the database. To correct these errors, the STAT first identified strata with positive catch in numbers but missing or zero values for catch in weight. Catch in weight for these strata was then estimated by imputing a value of average weight based on the mean of the reported average weights in the same year and subregion, which had a greater influence on average weight than boat mode (Figure \ref{fig:rec-avg-weights}). The effect of this data imputation was relatively minor for vermilion rockfish overall (\textasciitilde1\% increase in total catch by weight, 1980-2004). However, 70\% of missing catch in weight occurred over the years 2001-2004, with differences in individual year/mode/subregion combinations sometimes exceeding 10-20\%.

MRFSS catch estimates for California were spatially stratified into two subregions, ``Southern California'' (subregion 1) and ``Northern California'' (subregion 2). During the 1990-1992 statewide hiatus in sampling, the definitions of these two subregions changed. Specifically, San Luis Obispo (SLO) County was included in the southern region prior to the hiatus (i.e.~1980-1989) {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Witzig et al. 1992, Karpov et al. 1995)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, but moved to the northern subregion starting in 1993. In order to create a definition of spatial strata that is consistent and comparable over time, and one that is consistently divided near Point Conception, the STAT examined estimates of catch in numbers from a separate study {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Albin and Karpov 1993)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} that used a finer spatial resolution in the northern subregion (including SLO County). Over the period 1981-1986, numbers of vermilion rockfish landed in SLO County were found to be roughly equal to the numbers of vermilion rockfish landed in all California counties north of SLO County (Table \ref{tab:albin-allocate}). Therefore, to approximate catches north and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the `southern' subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by an amount equal to the northern subregion catch during the same period, and doubled the northern subregion catch. On average, this `moves' the estimated SLO County catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series.

Ultimately, the STAT chose to use recreational catch in numbers rather than catch in weight for the California assessment models. Since data from Albin {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1993)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were only available as catch in numbers, the ratios used to partition SLO County catch may not be consistent if applied to catch in weight due to differences in average weight between regions (Figure \ref{fig:rec-avg-weights}). Also, because missing weight estimates were concentrated over the period 2001-2004 rather than being spread over the entire time series, the method used to impute weights could have a greater influence on short-term stock dynamics.

As noted above, MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues. The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the PC boat mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County. To produce catch estimates for the missing subregion/mode/year combinations, we used linear interpolation. Shore modes were a minor component of the vermilion rockfish catch and therefore combined with catches from the private (PR) boat mode into a single fleet. Specifically, catches were aggregated by subregion (adjusted as described above), year, and mode, and endpoints for the interpolations were defined as 2-year averages to reduce the effects of interannual variability in catch on interpolated estimates.

The MRFSS did not collect data on the size composition of discarded fish (except in the program's last year, 2003), although recent CRFS sampling shows that the mean size of discarded fish is smaller than retained catch. Since catch type ``B1'' is an angler-reported mixture of dead discards and landed fish which were unavailable to the sampler, the true size composition of B1 fish is unknown. To determine the effect of alternative assumptions about the size composition of discarded fish, the STAT separated B1 fish into a separate fleet in the model. This allowed us to apply discard size composition data from the more recent CRFS survey, and compare the result to a model that assumes B1 catch has the same size composition as the examined catch. Results are described in the model sensitivity section. Since the ratio of B1 catch to total catch (A+B1) was highly variable among years, an average B1/(A+B1) ratio was estimated for each subregion and boat mode. These average discard ratios were applied to the annual estimates of total catch to estimate annual discarded catch prior to 2005.

MRFSS estimates of catch and discard (1000s of fish) after adjustment for changes in subregion definition and sampling gaps are shown in Table \ref{tab:landings}.

\emph{California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2020}

Estimates of recreational landings and discard since 2004 have been produced by the CRFS. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, employing higher sampling rates and producing estimates with finer spatial and temporal resolution. The CRFS also employs onboard CPFV observers, providing spatially referenced, drift-level estimates of catch and discard for a subset of anglers on observed groundfish trips, as well as length composition data for discarded catch. These data are extremely valuable to stock assessment (see the CRFS Onboard Index of Abundance Index for further details).

CRFS mortality estimates for the period 2005-2020 were queried from {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{www.recfin.org}{RecFIN}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Reported estimates were aggregated into subregion (north and south of Point Conception) and boat mode (PC and PR), and filtered to exclude fish caught in Mexican waters. Shore modes were a minor component of the recreational catch and were combined with the PR mode.

\emph{Discard mortality rates}

Total recreational mortality estimates provided to RecFIN are adjusted using species- and depth-specific discard mortality rates. The discard mortality rates for vermilion rockfish that were endorsed by the SSC and adopted by the PFMC in March 2017 are 20\% for 0-10 fm, 34\% for 10-20 fm, 50\% for 20-30 fm, and 100\% for greater than 30 fm.

Similar to the MRFSS data, CRFS discard estimates were treated as a separate fleet to evaluate the effect of alternative size composition assumptions on model results. Estimates of retained and released dead fish (in numbers) by subregion and mode are available from the RecFIN website, and these were used in the model. Other than combining PR and shore modes, the estimates described above were used without modification.

\emph{Recreational indices of abundance}

A number of indices of abundance were explored for the recreational fleet (Figure \ref{fig:cpueall}), noting there were limited recreational index data from 2020 due to COVID-19. Discarded catch is available from onboard observer surveys, but was not included in indices. The STAT considered developing separate indices for discards, but sample sizes were not large enough to warrant modeling. The CDFW CPFV logbook data were not considered as an index of abundance due to the fact that vermilion rockfish may not be accurately reported to the species level. Indices developed for the assessment include:

The West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS) is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Keller et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

Vermilion rockfish are strongly associated with rocky habitat, i.e., untrawlable habitat, but can be found over soft bottom, especially as juveniles. This survey spans the entire West Coast and provided data for both the northern and southern California assessments. However, this survey does not sample most rocky habitats, nor does the survey conduct sampling within the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) or the California state Marine Protected Area (MPA) network.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.} Vermilion rockfish are not found in high abundance in this survey, and in most cases lengths for the entire catch were available, i.e., few enough individuals were caught that all were measured. The assessment north of Point Conception includes 467 ages, which is the majority of the vermilion rockfish with available length information (587 total). South of Point Conception, 1,283 of the 1,962 vermilion rockfish observed and measured were also aged (Table \ref{tab:age-sample-size}). The length compositions by year of vermilion rockfish from the WCGBT survey are shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-data-NWFSC-TWL}.

\emph{Maturity samples.} Maturity samples were analyzed by by Melissa Head (NWFSC) and a description of the results is in the section on biological data.

\emph{Index of abundance.} The index was considered, but not used in the pre-STAR base model. VAST-WestCoast was explored for standardization of the WCBTS data both north and south of Point Conception. Unfortunately, results were uncertain given the small number of tows that observed vermilion rockfish. Truncating the spatial distribution of the survey to less than 300 m, which only eliminated a small handful of positive tows, did not decrease the uncertainty such that spatially-explicit parameters were estimable. Model convergence was more of an issue south of Point Conception rather than north of the break. Changing the distributional assumptions of the positive model or changing to a tweedie-like distribution that combines the two models did not increase the likelihood that the model could estimate spatially-explicit parameters. It was decided that a non-spatial model, which is more easily accomplished outside of the VAST framework would be best for all areas where the survey samples this species. Future research could investigate correlation structures between areas and if shared information across small regions of overlap would stabilize parameter estimation.

The STAT also developed a delta-glm model for each area (north and south of Point Conception). Full details of the final index are in the Appendix, including sample sizes, model selection criteria, and model diagnostics.

\subsubsection{NWFSC Hook and Line Survey}\label{nwfsc-hook-and-line-survey}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the survey are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion/sunset (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Composition data from the hook-and-line survey are assigned to two different fleets in the southern California base model. The survey area expanded into the CCAs in 2014, and index selectivity is linked to the composition data from 2014-2019. Composition data prior to 2014 are assigned to a ``dummy'' fleet to account for potential changes in selectivity, and allow the early years of the survey to inform growth and recruitment. Further details are provided below, in the base model description and the appendix for the index standardization model.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.} This survey provides a wealth of biological information for the stock assessment, including lengths of 22,720 vermilion and ages from 9,211 vermilion (Table \ref{tab:length-sample-size}). The length composition can be found in Figure \ref{fig:len-data-NWFSC-HKL} for the period 2014-2019 (sampling inside the CCAs) and Figure \ref{fig:len-data-EARLY-HKL} for years 2004-2013, when sampling was limited to areas outside the CCAs.

\emph{Index of Abundance.} The NWFSC hook-and-line survey has been used in a number of stock assessments.\\
Vermilion is one of the most common species encountered in the survey and is one of the only sources of information about the stock inside the CCAs, which have been closed to fishing since 2001. Details regarding the index of abundance, sample sizes and model selection can be found in the Appendices.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The CDFW conducted fishery-independent surveys in the Southern California Bight from 1976-1979 aboard research vessels. The purpose of the surveys was to capture \emph{Sebastes} species and determine composition (species, size and age) of fish and to estimate size at maturity. The whereabouts of the majority of the data from these cruises is unknown. Bottom trawling in nearshore waters for juvenile rockfish was conducted, but those data are unavailable. This collection of survey data is also referred to as the ``green binder'' survey, as the data were discovered in green binders. The SWFSC keypunched the available data and also houses some of the otoliths collected during this study. It may be possible in the future to recover additional data from available cruise reports.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.} A total of 389 vermilion otoliths that were matched to available data (including sex, when available) from 1976-1977 and contained information on sex were aged for the assessment. A total of 1,442 lengths spanning 1976-1979 were also included (Figure \ref{fig:len-data-CDFW-RESEARCH}).

\subsection{Additional Considered Data Sources}\label{additional-considered-data-sources}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The STAT considered the following data sources, but found that vermilion rockfish were not well sampled and no further analysis was conducted.

\emph{NWFSC Triennial Survey}

The Triennial Survey was first conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dark and Wilkins 1994)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continental shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to $40^\circ 10^\prime N$. In 2004, the final year of the Triennial Survey series, the NWFSC Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division (FRAM) conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

\emph{Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey}

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V \emph{Miller Freeman}. Partial survey coverage of the US West Coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

\emph{Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans}

The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{http://www.piscoweb.org/kelp-forest-study}{PISCO-UCSC}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, conducts a number of surveys to monitor the kelp forests, one of which is a subtidal fish survey. PISCO has monitored fish population in the 0-20 m depth range as part of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) since 1998. Paired sites inside and outside MPAs are surveyed to monitor the long-term dynamics of the kelp forest ecosystem and provide insight into the effect of MPAs on kelp forest species. PISCO conducts the fish surveys from late July through September. At each site, benthic, midwater, and canopy scuba transects are conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 20 m depth. All divers are trained in species identification. Along each 30 m transect, divers enumerate all identifiable non-cryptic fish, and estimate total length to the nearest centimeter. PISCO surveys are conducted by the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in central California and the University of California Santa Barbara in southern California.

\emph{California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations}

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) survey began in 1951 and conducts quarterly cruises off southern and central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data at fixed stations and while underway; ichthyoplankon sampling with a paired bongo started in 1978. Data on larval abundance from the CalCOFI Ichthyoplankton survey have been used in stock assessments of several species, including bocaccio, cowcod and shortbelly rockfish. Although the long-term dataset is limited to a subset of species for which morphological identification of larvae has been possible, recent research has been successful at identifying a broader range of species based on genetic identification of larvae {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thompson et al. 2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Vermilion rockfish cannot be identified morphologically in the ichthyoplankton samples. Of more than 20,000 larvae identified in the 1998-2013 time period, only nine were vermilion rockfish. Consequently, the data are insufficient at this time to use to inform relative abundance, although Thompson et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} do provide several relative abundance time series for other taxa, and future efforts may lead to better taxonomic resolution of historical or future collections.

\emph{Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Survey}

Since 1983, the SWFSC has conducted an annual midwater trawl survey for pelagic juvenile rockfish and other groundfish in the Central California region of the California Current (Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and references therein). Due to concerns about mesoscale abundance patterns and a need for greater spatial representation in the data, including some apparent strong differences in spatial distribution patterns in the early 2000s {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hastie and Ralston 2007, Ralston et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, this survey was expanded to a broader spatial scale in the 2001-2004 period, and since 2004 most years have coastwide data from a combination of SWFSC, NWFSC and Cooperative Research surveys (see Field et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for more complete details regarding coastwide pre-recruit data, and Sakuma et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and Friedman et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2018)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for additional details and alternative applications of survey data). Only 47 of nearly 300,000 total juvenile \emph{Sebastes} encountered in the juvenile surveys since 2001 were identified as vermillion or sunset rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Field et al. 2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Despite this, the assessment results suggest that at least a reasonable fraction of recruitment variability for sunset and vermillion rockfish is shared with other rockfish and groundfish stocks throughout the California Current, many of which also had strong year classes in 1984, 1999 and 2015, and future investigations could lead to the development of multispecies-based recruitment indicators that could be helpful for future assessments.

\emph{California Collaborative Research Program}

In 2017 the California Collaborative Research Program (CCFRP) expanded state-wide and now samples four MPAs and associated references sites in southern California.\\
Vermilion rockfish have been encountered at two of the MPAs (Carrington Point off Santa Rosa Island and South La Jolla) and observed in 27\% of all drifts at these two locations. The STAT determined that the available data were too constrained spatially and temporally to be considered for an index of abundance. There are currently 262 lengths of vermilion available. With additional years of data, this data set can be considered for inclusion in a future southern California vermilion assessment.

\emph{Southern California Bight Publicly Owned Treatment Works}

In the Southern California Bight, a number of monitoring programs exist to evaluate the potential consequences of effluent discharges from wastewater treatment facilities on the coastal marine environment. As over 20 million people live within an hour's drive of the ocean in this region, a major impact to this ecosystem includes a cumulative total of 1.5 billion liters of treated effluent released each day to the ocean, originating from 17 major wastewater treatment plants {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Schiff et al. 2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Most of these publicly owned treatment works support monitoring programs to evaluate the impacts on water and sediment quality, and associated ecological communities. For several, this includes bottom trawl surveys of coastal habitats, and data from the longest running trawl surveys, despite being limited spatially to waters closer to population centers, have previously been used in stock assessments of cowcod (\emph{Sebastes levis}) {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick and He 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and California scorpionfish (\emph{Scorpaena guttata}) {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Monk et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Cowcod were rarely encountered in these surveys, occurring in 139 of the 1896 trawls conducted by the most rigorous of the surveys, and the development of a relative abundance index required pooling data into five year ``blocks'' in order to provide plausible estimates of year effects. The resulting index was not highly influential in the final assessment model {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick and He 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and the lumping of years was only acceptable in that model because recruitments were not estimated. By contrast, California scorpionfish were frequently encountered in several of these surveys, with over 10,000 fish being observed (and measured) over the history of those surveys, and the resulting relative abundance index and length frequently data were very influential in the California scorpionfish assessment with respect to both trends and recruitment {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Monk et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. As preliminary investigations suggested that vermilion rockfish are even rarer than cowcod in this survey, and because grouping years of data would be inappropriate where recruitments are being estimated, a more rigorous evaluation of these datasets was not developed for this assessment. However, it could be feasible to consider such an evaluation in future stock assessments.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \ref{fig:reader1reader2}). Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described above. The same readers aged otoliths for both California vermilion rockfish stock assessment models. Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts (CARE) exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson et al. 2012)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Reader 1 who was more experienced, was assumed to be unbiased. The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} among the top three models was less than two. The best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard deviation for both readers. An analysis of ageing error after removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 selected the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation (Figure \ref{fig:oldfish}). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence interval using this model (Figure \ref{fig:truereads}). The latter model was selected for use in the assessment and the distribution of true age and observed age is in Figure \ref{fig:ageerror}.

The resulting estimates of ageing error indicated a standard deviation in age readings increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Maturity at length of nominal vermilion rockfish was previously studied by Wyllie Echeverria {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1987)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} from fish collected off central California. She found that 50\% of females sampled were mature by 37 cm total length, and 50\% of males were mature by 38 cm total length. Love et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1990)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reported 37 cm total length for female size at 50\% maturity, based on fish collected in southern California. Phillips {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1964)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reported a size at 50\% maturity of 13 inches (33 cm) total length, although the sampling location of the fish used to determine maturity for that study was not specified within California.

For the current assessment, Melissa Head (NWFSC, pers. comm.) determined maturity for 545 female vermilion rockfish caught by recent fishery-independent surveys. Two types of maturity determinations were provided, `biological maturity' and `functional maturity.' The former category includes ``juveniles exhibiting dummy runs (early vitellogenesis or yolk granules present in a small proportion of oocytes, some in early stages of cellular decay) and skip spawners (adults foregoing spawning in a given year)'' (M. Head, pers. comm.), while the latter excludes such cases. A logistic regression was fit to the functional maturity determination as a function of fork length (Figure \ref{fig:functional-maturity}), estimating length at 50\% maturity at 38.4 cm, with a slope of -0.312, based on the parameterization in Stock Synthesis. The samples available from areas north of Point Conception were smaller fish and did not allow for estimates of separate maturity curves. Both California vermilion rockfish assessments assumed the same maturity ogive (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).

Phillips {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1964)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reported fecundity for nominal ``vermilion'' rockfish collected in waters off California. Based on a sample of 12 fish ranging in size from 315-550 mm total length, he reported the minimum and maximum number of eggs as 63,300 and 1,625,600 per female, respectively. Love et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1990)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimated fecundity of fish in southern California, and reported an allometric fecundity - length relationship (eggs vs.~total length, cm) with an exponent of 5.02, suggesting a significant increase in weight-specific fecundity with female size given a roughly cubic weight-length relationship. Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} conducted a meta-analysis of \emph{Sebastes} fecundity-length relationships. Insufficient data were available to model the subgenus \emph{Rosicola}, but the predictive distribution of the fecundity-length exponent for the genus as whole centered around a value of four, supporting a general pattern of increasing weight-specific fecundity among the \emph{Sebastes}. Analyses to date have not examined size-dependent changes in brood frequency for vermilion or sunset rockfish, i.e.~current fecundity estimates represent brood fecundity.

For this assessment, new observations of fecundity at length were supplied by S. Beyer (UCSC / SWFSC, pers. comm.). These data were combined with digitized historical data sets used by Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to estimate a new fecundity-length relationship (Figure \ref{fig:fitted-fecundity}). The relationship between fecundity (millions of eggs) and fork length (cm) estimated from these data and used in the assessment was {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(F = 2.8e^{-9}L^{4.97}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}

The resulting relationship between fecundity by female weight (kg) is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}, with spawning output at age (the product of maturity and fecundity) in Figure \ref{fig:spawnage}.

\hypertarget{natural-mortality}{%
\subsubsection{Natural Mortality}\label{natural-mortality}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool}{NMT}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2018)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} functional regression model and is a commonly applied method for West Coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user.

The STATs for the four vermilion rockfish assessment models all used the same prior for natural mortality across models. We assumed the age of 54 years to represent the practical longevity (i.e., 90\% of the commonly seen maximum age of 60) for both females and males, though the absolute oldest age in Oregon was \textgreater60 years. In California, fish aged at 80+ were encountered. Empirical {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimators using the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered, but they produced unreasonably high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely explained by the fact that vermilion rockfish have protracted longevity at {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Additionally, the FishLife {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson and Barnett 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimate was included, though, given the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} are also from methods using longevity, though the actual source of longevity in FishLife was unknown. Both California vermilion rockfish assessments used the Hamel prior {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, which is defined as a lognormal with log-scale mean = {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(ln\frac{5.4}{A_{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and SE = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 54 the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.1, which is used as a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} in the assessment model.

\textbf{Vermilion Rockfish Recommendations}

Investigation into the species composition of nominal vermilion rockfish is needed. It is not clear that separate assessments for the northern and southern areas are warranted for vermilion rockfish. Although there were differences in the estimated magnitude and timing of recruitment events, the estimated stock trends were similar in both areas. Pooling of data from northern and southern areas may permit a more robust assessment model to be obtained.

\emph{2021 STAT Response.} Since the 2005 assessment, vermilion rockfish were speciated to vermilion and sunset rockfishes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Sunset rockfish are more common south of Pt. Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) and historical catches and length distributions between the two areas are different. The STAT discussed this at the Pre-Assessment Workshop and all participants agreed that modeling the areas separately was an appropriate decision.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

A decision was made by the STAT after discussions with the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Groundfish Management Team and Groundfish Advisory Panel to model the areas north and south of Point Conception independently for a number of reasons. These included a discussion of the evidence supporting higher densities of sunset rockfish south of Point Conception and the general decline in vermilion rockfish density as latitude increases. The preliminary exploration of length data also suggested that the size composition of landed fish north and south of Point Conception differed in a number of fleets. The STAT maintained consistency across the two models when the data supported the decisions, i.e., maintaining the same recreational and commercial fleet structures and sharing biological data from the more data-rich southern assessment.

The structure of the California models north and south of Point Conception are very similar. Population dynamics in both regions operate on an annual time step and are initialized from an unfished equilibrium condition in 1875. Sex-specific age and length structure is modeled from age 0 (recruitment age) to an accumulator age (plus group) of 70, with 1-cm population length bins ranging from 6-70 cm. Length data bins are 2-cm wide, and range from 8-70 cm in the south and 10-70 cm in the north. Expected recruitment is assumed to follow a Beverton-Holt function of spawning output, with lognormally-distributed recruitment deviations. Growth (male and female) is modeled using the Schnute parameterization of von Bertalanffy growth, with two estimated lengths (ages 0 and 30) and a growth rate coefficient (\emph{k}). The major differences between the two models are the availability of fishery-independent data sources that are region-specific, and the parameterization of male growth and mortality parameters (details below).

The models in both regions are conditioned on catches from the commercial and recreational sectors. The commercial sector is divided into three fleets (hook-and-line, trawl, and net gears). Landings from minor commercial gears were a negligible component of the total harvest and were combined with the hook-and-line fleet. The recreational sector was divided into four fleets according to boat mode (party/charter or private/rental) and catch type (retained or discarded). This follows the same practice as a number of other recent rockfish stock assessments, where the ability to accurately estimate a retention curve is complicated by depth-dependent discard mortality rates.

Vermilion rockfish is a desirable species and discards are a small component of total fishing mortality in both the commercial and recreational sectors. The commercial catches do not include dead discards, which were estimated to be a small percent of the overall landings in both areas (averaging 7.4 mt coastwide since 2015, although increasing since 2017). In addition, there were very few observations available from WCGOP (fewer than 250 fish statewide). The size distribution of recreational discards from the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs represented larger fish from periods when the recreational shelf rockfish fishery closed versus smaller fish discarded when the fishery was open. Fish discarded during trips when vermilion rockfish were prohibited were removed from the recreational PC discard fleet length composition.

The southern California model is fit to three fishery-dependent indices of relative abundance: 1) MRFSS CPFV dockside, 2) CDFW onboard observer, and 3) CRFS PR1 dockside. The MRFSS CPFV dockside index is assumed to be proportional to changes in the relative abundance of the recreational party/charter fleet (retained fish only). The CDFW onboard observer index represents the same fleet (rec party/charter), but indexes change in abundance during recent years. The onboard index is specified as a separate ``survey'' fleet in the model because it overlaps in time with the MRFSS dockside time series. Both the MRFSS and onboard indices use the recreational party/charter fleet's selectivity curve to define vulnerable size classes. The CRFS PR1 dockside index is linked to the recreational private/rental boat fleet (retained fish), and uses the same selectivity curve. Recreational length measurements are included as marginal length compositions (proportions at length, sexes combined) by year starting in 1975 and 1978 for the PC and PR modes, respectively. Fishery-dependent length composition data are also included for the commercial hook-and-line and net fleets, but trawl length data were too sparse to be used for estimating trawl-specific selectivity parameters. Age structures from the commercial fleets were also sparse and not considered for the southern California assessment.

Fishery-independent data sources in the southern California model are organized into four fleets. The primary data source is the NWFSC hook-and-line survey. Data from this survey were used to create an index of relative abundance, marginal length compositions by sex and year, and conditional-age-at-length data by sex and year. Length and age data from the hook-and-line survey were broken into two fleets to better match assumptions in the index standardization methodology (see Appendix for details). The NWFSC trawl survey is the second fishery-independent data source in the southern model. An abundance index was developed for the trawl survey, but ultimately rejected due to high interannual variability, sparse data, and imprecise estimates. However, trawl survey conditional-age-at-length data and associated marginal length comps, both by sex and year, were retained in the model. The earliest available age and length composition data came from assorted CDFW research cruises which are collectively known as the ``green binder'' data (see data section for additional information).

\textbf{Changes from the pre-STAR base model to the post-STAR base model} Two suggestions from the STAR panel were incorporated into the final base model. These were 1) implement a time-block in 2017 to represent changes in selectivity for the commercial hook-and-line fishery resulting from regulatory changes, and 2) estimate steepness.

Length-based selectivity is modeled using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis. Selectivity parameters were estimated for the commercial hook-and-line fleet and the commercial net fleet. The commercial trawl fleet is mirrored to the commercial hook-and-line fleet due to sparse sampling and the minor contribution of trawl landings to total harvest in southern California. Selectivity was estimated for the recreational PC fleet, recreational PC discard fleet and the Recreational PR fleet. There were no length data available for the recreational PR discard fleet, and it mirrors the selectivity of the recreational PC discard fleet. Selectivity for the recreational PC onboard index of abundance is mirrored to the recreational PC fleet as they share the same length composition. Length-based selectivity parameters were estimated for all fishery-independent data sources. Age-based selectivity was set equal to 1 for all ages in all fleets, except for the NWFSC trawl survey which has a selectivity of 0 for young-of-the-year (age 0) fish.

The length composition sample sizes for some years and fleets was small, and observations may not be representative of the total catch. Years with insufficient data were excluded from the likelihood, and initial sample sizes (prior to data weighting) for length composition data were set equal to a proxy such as the number or trips, hauls, or sampling events (as described in Tables \ref{tab:length-sample-size} and \ref{tab:length-inputN}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The population dynamics model has many parameters, some estimated using the available data in the assessment and some fixed at values either determined external to the assessment or informed by the available data. Estimated and fixed parameter values, including associated properties (bounds, priors, asymptotic standard errors), are in Table \ref{tab:paramstable}.

A total of 115 parameters were estimated in the base model, including recruitment deviations. Time-invariant growth parameters (Brody growth coefficient, lengths at age 0 and age 30, and CV old/young) using the Schnute parameterization of the von Bertalanffy growth function were estimated for each sex, with male values parameterized as exponential offsets from female parameters. The CV of the distribution of length-at-age, CV(L), in the base model is estimated at the lower and upper ages specified in the Schnute parameterization of von Bertalanffy growth, and a linear interpolation between these 2 parameters is a function of age. This choice was based on visual inspection of the relationship between CV(L) and age, using the NWFSC hook-and-line survey data (Figure \ref{fig:cv-length-age}). Natural mortality was estimated using a parameter for both sexes and informed by a prior distribution. Natural mortality for males was assumed equal to female (exponential offset fixed at zero). Selectivity varied by fleet, and was assumed to be either asymptotic or domed for retained fleets, and forced to be domed for discard fleets with initial and final selectivity fixed at zero. Most selectivity parameters were assumed to be time-invariant, except time blocks were used to capture changes in selectivity associated with regulatory changes around 2001 (see regulations section). Recruitment deviations were estimated in the base model from 1965 -- 2020. Initial (unifshed equilibrium) recruitment was also estimated. An extra standard deviation parameter was estimated for the PR mode abundance index, as the externally estimated CVs were small due to extremely large sample sizes (1000s of trips).

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfish. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}; beta distribution with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\mu\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.72 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.16) is retained.

A prior for natural mortality was developed using the method of Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The STAT examined the distribution of ages from the NWFSC hook-and-line survey and found that roughly 99.9\% of otoliths aged were in the mid-50s or younger. Therefore an approximate maximum age of 54 was selected, giving a median estimate of 0.1 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(yr^{-1}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the prior. The STAT notes that the recommended log-scale standard deviation of 0.438 for the prior makes it only weakly informative, so small changes to the prior's median value do not affect estimates of \emph{M} and other assessment results.

Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) composition sample sizes for the base model were tuned by the ``Francis method,'' based on equation TA1.8 in Francis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and implemented in the r4ss package (Table \ref{tab:data-weights}).

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the McAllister-Ianelli harmonic mean method {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(McAllister, Murdoch K.; Ianelli 1997)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. See the model sensitivity section for a comparison of the Francis and McAllister-Ianelli results. Additionally, weighting using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) that scales the input sample size, was explored. However, all estimates of the ratio of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\theta/(1+\theta)\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were greater than 0.99, which indicates the models is trying to tune the sample sizes unchanged. Given this result, the STAT chose not to further explore the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting. As a note, there is a bug in SS Version 3.30.16.00 that prevents the number of estimated weights from being larger than the number of fleets. This was fixed in SS Version 3.30.16.01 and this version was only used for exploration of the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting.

\subsubsection{Key Assumptions and Structural Choices}\label{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The STAT used sensitivity analyses to evaluate robustness of the pre-STAR base models to key assumptions and structural choices. The major structural choices in both California assessments were 1) the use of a single, stationary, and closed population model to describe the aggregate population dynamics and biological parameters of the cryptic species pair in each region, 2) density-dependence entirely characterized by a Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship, 3) that natural mortality rates can be adequately estimated from available data, and 4) time blocks based on major regulatory changes adequately characterize changes in size-selectivity of fishing gear over time. The catch histories of vermilion and sunset rockfishes are inseparable at this time, making estimation of species-specific fishing mortality rates impossible. Ongoing research may shed light on this issue, and help improve our understanding of potential differences between the species (e.g., vital rates) that could influence estimates of stock productivity and sustainable yield.

Model convergence was examined by starting the minimization algorithm from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. ``Jitter'' is an option in SS that generates random starting values from a normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Methot, R.

The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001, when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability.

Female {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} was estimated at 0.16, slightly lower than the estimates for males of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 0.18 (exponential offset of 0.13). Females reached a larger size at {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{age=30}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 55 cm than males, which reached 52 cm at estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{age=30}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} (Figure \ref{fig:fittedgrowth}).

Fits to the marginal and conditional age at length data sets were best for the NWFSC hook-and-line survey, which is not surprising given that this survey accounted for the majority of age at length observations (over 9000). Similar to the northern model, the largest residuals were associated with infrequently encountered, older individuals, and no significant residual patterns were apparent. The model was able to reproduce interannual changes in mean age reasonably well, with the exception of 2009, when observed average age was unusually high (\textasciitilde5 years higher than surrounding years), but also had the largest variance.

Fits to the time-aggregated length comps were best for the commercial, recreational, and NWFSC survey fleets (Figure \ref{fig:lenfits-all}). The NWFSC trawl survey does not effectively sample primary adult habitat types, resulting in a multi-modal length frequency distribution that is difficult for the model to reproduce (Figure \ref{fig:lenfits-all}). Fits to the early CDFW research fleet are poor, but the data informing these years are relatively sparse in comparison to current sampling programs such as CRFS. Length composition data from the recreational fleets show evidence of modal progressions due to strong year classes (e.g., the 1999 year class showing up around 2002), there are no patterns in the pearson residual plots, and the model is able to track associated changes in mean length over time.

The commercial hook-and-line fleet (and mirrored commercial trawl fleet) were fit to time-varying asymptotic selectivity and the size at full selectivity shifts to smaller fish in the more recent time block (from 50 cm to 34 cm). The most likely change in selectivity for the commercial fleet is the implementation of the CCAs and additional regulatory changes in the early 2000s. Catches from the commercial net fishery declined prior to the CCAs. The length compositions from the net fishery did not support a dome shaped selectivity and parameters were fixed to have asymptotic selectivity (Figure \ref{fig:endyr-selex-COM-NET}).

Dome-shaped selectivity for the recreational PC and PR fleets are similar with the PR fleet encountering smaller fish than the PC fleet, whereas the recreational discards fleet rarely discards any fish larger than \textasciitilde35 cm (Figures \ref{fig:endyr-selex-REC-PC}, \ref{fig:endyr-selex-REC-PC-DIS}, \ref{fig:endyr-selex-REC-PR}). A number of regulatory changes (e.g., establishment of the CCAs, depth restrictions) supported time blocks in both recreational retained fleets and resulted in narrower selectivity patterns in the 2000s.

Both fishery-independent hook-and-line surveys were fit to asymptotic selectivity because attempts to estimate dome-shaped selectivity resulted in poorly informed parameters (very large SEs) for terminal selectivity and the descending width. The length composition data from 2004-2013 for the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey were fit as a `dummy' fleet, and allowed to take a dome shape due to the lack of sampling inside the CCA where fish of larger size were observed.

Peak selectivity for the WCGBTS was fixed at the smallest length bin (Figure \ref{fig:endyr-selex-NWFSC-TWL}), and attempts to estimate other parameters (e.g., descending width) were unsuccessful, with the parameter hitting the lower bound near zero.

Fits to the indices vary in quality. Two of the three recreational indices represented the PC fleet. The MRFSS era dockside interview index was fit moderately well given the uncertainty in some years, but the model was not able to adequately reproduce the first and last observations of the time series or the rate of decline in the late 1990s, as indicated by a short run of negative residuals (1995-1998) (Figures \ref{fig:log-cpue-REC-PC} and \ref{fig:cpue-resid-REC-PC}). The CDFW onboard index, which now contains 21 years of data was fit well and captures the trend from the standardized index; there was also not a strong pattern to the residuals (Figures \ref{fig:log-cpue-REC-PC-ONBOARD} and \ref{fig:cpue-resid-REC-PC-ONBOARD}).

An additional variance parameter was estimated for the recreational PR dockside index. The index was positively correlated with the base model predictions, but the relationship was not strong and most residuals shifted from positive to negative after 2011 (Figures \ref{fig:log-cpue-REC-PR} and \ref{fig:cpue-resid-REC-PR}). The NWFSC hook-and-line survey index was fit well through 2016, with the model capturing a general trend of increasing abundance, but the model did not capture the pattern of increased abundance in the last three years. Since the survey moved into the CCAs in 2014, the increase since 2017 does not appear to be related to the change in survey design (Figures \ref{fig:log-cpue-NWFSC-HKL} and \ref{fig:cpue-resid-NWFSC-HKL}).

Spawning output south of Point Conception declined rapidly throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to a level below the Minimum Stock Size Threshold (MSST), but catches decreased enough in the 2000s for the stock to reach a stable level of spawning output (Table \ref{tab:timeseries}, Figure \ref{fig:spawnout}). Stock size is estimated to have been at the lowest level in the mid-1990s, but has since increased, in part due to an exceptionally strong recruitment in 1999, followed by several years of above-average recruitment. The stock is estimated to have been below the management target of (40\% of unfished spawning output) from 1986-2007 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}. Relative exploitation rates ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\frac{1-SPR}{1-SPR_{50\%}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) increased through time, exceeding target levels from the mid-1970s through the late 1990s. Exploitation over the past decade has fluctuated around target levels (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}), with catches almost entirely landed by the recreational sector.

Vermilion spawning output in northern California was estimated to be 4471 million eggs in 2021 (95\% asymptotic interval: 229 - 714 million eggs) or 48\% (95\% asymptotic interval: 26\% - 71\%) of unfished spawning output in 2021(``depletion,'' Table \ref{tab:ssbES} and Figures \ref{fig:spawnout} and \ref{fig:depl}). In 2021, vermilion biomass south of Point Conception is estimated to be above the target biomass level, while experiencing fishing intensity around the SPR fishing intensity target (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). The equilibrium yield curve is shifted left, as expected given the assumed value for the Beverton-Holt steepness parameter (h=0.72)(Figures \ref{fig:yield2} and \ref{fig:yield3}). Harvest rates in southern California in 2020 were below target, and the stock was above the target biomass (Figure \ref{fig:phase}).

Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95\% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}.

Major recruitments (strong year classes) in southern California were consistently estimated by the primary sources of age data (NWFSC hook-and-line and trawl surveys), with a strong 1999 year class estimated even when either data set is removed (see sensitivity section). Other years with relatively high estimates of recruitment were 1983-84, 1999, and 2016 (Figures \ref{fig:recruits}, \ref{fig:recdevs}, \ref{fig:bh-curve}, and \ref{fig:bh-resids}). These are consistent with estimates of strong year classes in other rockfish stock assessments. Due to ageing error, years adjacent to strong (or weak) cohorts are sometimes estimated as having similar deviations.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model, 2020.

The spawning output equivalent to 40\% of the unfished level ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 391.13 million eggs.

The 2021 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished levels (Figure \ref{fig:depl}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

All sensitivities in this section use the \textbf{pre-STAR} base model.

To better understand how data from individual fishery sectors or scientific surveys affected assessment results, we excluded data sets from the likelihood, one fleet at a time (referred to here as a ``drop-one'' analysis). ``Fleet'' in this sense refers to either a fishing fleet or a survey ``fleet.'' To do this, we set ``lambdas'' (multipliers for each likelihood component) equal to zero. This is equivalent to removing the data from the model. When composition data were excluded, the selectivity parameters for that fleet were fixed at the base model estimates to standardize the size and age composition of harvested fish. When abundance indices were excluded, relevant catchability and `extraSE' parameters associated with the index were not estimated. Composition data weights for the remaining fleets were kept consistent with the base model values. Results from all the `drop-one' runs were compared to the base model using time series plots and tables containing likelihood components, parameter estimates and derived quantities.

For the southern California model, the NWFSC hook-and-line (HKL) survey is divided across two fleets (8 and 12; see survey description in the Fishery-Independent Data sources section). For consistency with other `drop-one' runs, fleets 8 and 12 were excluded at the same time to remove all data associated with the hook-and-line survey. Removal of the HKL survey fleet (index, length comps, and age comps) resulted in larger estimates of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:drop-spawnbio}), and affected the trend in spawning biomass in recent years. Only removal of the REC\_PC fleet had a noticeable effect on spawning output in the terminal year, but the difference was well within the estimated range of uncertainty from the base model. Relative spawning output (`depletion') estimates showed little change relative to the range of plausible outcomes predicted by the base model (Figure \ref{fig:drop-bratio}). Removal of the REC\_PC fleet reduced the magnitude of negative recruitment deviations estimated in the 1970s, as well as the strength of the 1999 year class (Figure \ref{fig:drop-recdev}), but most general patterns in recruitment were consistent across the set of drop-one sensitivity tests. Changes in likelihoods, parameter estimates and derived quantities are recorded in Tables \ref{tab:drop-one} and \ref{tab:drop-one2}. Comparison of likelihoods among drop-one scenarios should be treated with caution due to changes in the data sets that were fit in each model run.

\hypertarget{sensitivity-to-catch-uncertainty}{%
\subsubsection{Sensitivity to Catch Uncertainty}\label{sensitivity-to-catch-uncertainty}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

To evaluate the influence of highly uncertain catch histories, we developed several sensitivity analyses. A ``typical'' sensitivity is to both halve and double historical catches, which tend to be far more uncertain than catches in the more recent and better documented era, particularly for rockfish (\emph{Sebastes}). This is because historically most rockfish were landed in mixed stock market categories such as ``unspecified rockfish'' or ``group red rockfish,'' and the species composition of these market categories were not sampled until the recent era (1978 in central and northern California, 1983 in the Southern California Bight). However, as described in the historical catch section, recent evaluations have suggested that historical catches in the Southern California Bight may be more uncertain than previously realized. Specifically, vermilion rockfish was explicitly described as ``one of the most important commercial species, it is one of the three leading species (of rockfish) in''southern California'' {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Roedel 1948)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The other two of the most important commercial species in southern waters were bocaccio, which is estimated to represented nine percent of total rockfish catch in southern waters between 1916 and 1950, and 20\% between 1916 and 1968; and chilipepper, estimated to represent 11\% of the catch between 1916 and 1950 and 14\% between 1916 and 1968. However, the catch reconstruction estimated that vermilion rockfish catch to be less than five percent of the historical total for this region, while several species that were not described or described as ``minor'' importance were estimated to represent 10\% or more of the catch (including bank, blackgill, bronzespotted and cowcod rockfish). The former two in particular are more deeply distributed slope species that were unlikely to represent a large fraction of catches in the 1920s and 1930s {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

One partial explanation for the discrepancy is that market category 959, which is described as ``group red'' rockfish was rarely used until the late 1930s and early 1940s, but likely accounted for much of the vermilion rockfish catch from that period onward. Thus, vermilion rockfish would have been included in other market categories, such as market category 250, ``unspecified rockfish,'' which accounted for half of the total rockfish catch early in the historical period. By the time species composition data were actually collected in the early 1980s, that market category would have very few vermilion rockfish, as most would have been sorted into ``group red'' or the ``vermilion rockfish'' (249) market categories. Consequently, when recent species composition data were applied to the historical market category catches, the fraction estimated to be vermilion rockfish would be biased low, and vermilion rockfish would be underrepresented in the earliest portion of the landings history. To evaluate a plausible alternative to the current estimates, we evaluated the consequences of assuming that both 10\% and 20\% of the total rockfish catches in the Southern California Bight were vermilion rockfish (comparable to the other two ``leading species''). This effect would have likely been reduced from the late 1950s and early 1960s onward, thus for these sensitivities we only applied the higher catch levels to the pre-1969 time period (e.g., the time period of the historical reconstruction). These sensitivities were done in addition to both halving and doubling catches (both commercial and recreational) for the entire pre-1980 time period.

The halving and doubling of catches did lead to substantive differences in estimates of stock status, with a slightly more pessimistic perception in the doubling of historical catches and a slightly more optimistic perception in the halving (Figures \ref{fig:sens2-depl} and \ref{fig:sens2-spr}). However, the treatment of only pre-1969 commercial catches did not lead to substantive changes in the perception of stock status, only a slight scaling of historical spawning output and an increase in historical harvest rates, resulted in a considerably earlier and more rapid stock decline relative to the base model. Associated with that increased scaling of historical spawning output was a slight increase in the equilibrium MSY level, by one to three tons depending on the scenario. The halving and doubling of all historical catches prior to 1980 had a more substantive effect on the estimated equilibrium MSY level, decreasing by approximately four tons and increasing by \textasciitilde18 tons, respectively. However, there is less evidence to support a doubling of both relatively recent (60s through 70s) commercial catches and of recreational catches at this time. Given the relatively modest influence on the model results, and the need for more rigorous investigations and improvements to historical catch estimates (which are best done as an overarching effort on all historical catches), additional efforts to improve these estimates are likely more appropriate for future research recommendations.

Trends in spawning output for the southern California assessment model were generally robust to this set of sensitivities. However, recent estimates of spawning output were much lower when using McAllister-Ianelli data weights, relative to the Francis method used in the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-spawnb}). The model tuned to McAllister-Ianelli weights was below target biomass, while the other models that used Francis weights showed similar trends in depletion and were above target biomass (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-bratio}). The McAllister-Ianelli approach estimated a natural mortality rate that was about 20\% lower than the Francis method (Tables \ref{tab:sens1}). Best estimates from all runs were within the estimated range of uncertainty for the base model. Steepness in the southern region was estimated at a similar value than the prior mean (estimated at 0.77 vs.~fixed at 0.72), and estimation of this parameter did not have a large effect on uncertainty in spawning output or recruitment deviations. The use of McAllister-Ianelli weights had the greatest impact on estimated recruitment deviations (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-recdevs}). This weighting method increased the variance of the estimated deviations as well as the estimated strength of the 1999 year class, relative to the models using the Francis approach. Changing the start date of the recruitment deviations had almost no effect. The McAllister-Ianelli method gives greater weight to the composition data for this model (Table \ref{tab:data-weights}).

During the STAR panel review, the STAT presented results from several sensitivity runs that were completed after distribution of the draft assessment document. All runs were conducted with the pre-STAR base models. These included:\\
- Fixing the natural mortality rate (M) to a value consistent with the observed maximum age when applying the Hamel prior (i.e., M = 5.4/80 = 0.07 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(yr^{-1}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend})\\
- Assuming asymptotic (2-parameter) selectivity curves for all fleets, except for recreational discard and the NWFSC trawl survey)\\
- Estimating domed (4-parameter) selectivity curves for all fleets, but allowing for asymptotic shapes when supported by the data.\\
- Use of a 3-parameter, reparameterized Ricker stock-recruitment relationship instead of a standard, 2-parameter Beverton-Holt relationship.\\
- ``Direct'' estimation of male natural mortality and growth parameters, in contrast to the base model, which uses an exponential offset parameterization for male parameters and fixes male M = female M.\\
- Reduce the input variance of the NWFSC HKL index, forcing the model to fit the index better.

The STAT compared several results from these runs to the pre-STAR base model, including time series of spawning output, relative spawning output, and recruitment deviations (Figures \ref{fig:sens3a}, \ref{fig:sens3b}, and \ref{fig:sens3c}). Negative log likelihoods (total and by data type), parameter estimates, and derived quantities were also examined relative to the pre-STAR base (Table \ref{tab:sens3}). Fixing M at 0.07 degraded the overall fit to the data, increasing the likelihood by more than 38 points. The model with forced asymptotic selectivity did not converge (parameters hit bounds), estimated a natural mortality rate that was inconsistent with the observed ages (M=0.26) and had a higher total negative likelihood. Estimating 4 selectivity parameters per fleet (excluding the discard and NWFSC trawl survey) produced results similar to the pre-base model. The STAT notes that the post-STAR base model allowed for greater flexibility in time-varying selectivity for the commercial hook-and-line fleet, relative to the pre-STAR base, so results from this sensitivity may differ if applied to the post-STAR base model. Parameters from a reparameterized Ricker stock-recruitment relationship were estimable (Table \ref{tab:sens3}) with M fixed at 0.12, but produced results that were generally consistent with the Beverton-Holt relationship assumed in the base model. However, uncertainty in spawning output and relative stock status were greatly increased under the 3-parameter Ricker model (Figures \ref{fig:sens3a} and \ref{fig:sens3b}). Sex-specific estimates of the natural mortality rate were similar to the combined estimate in the base model, and within one standard deviation based on reported asymptotic standard errors of the parameters. Lastly, reducing the input standard errors for the NWFSC hook-and-line survey had the expected effect of improving the fit to the index, but degraded the overall model fit (Table \ref{tab:sens3}). The improved fit to the hook-and-line index was mainly accomplished through a reduction in the estimated natural mortality rate, slowing the rate of population increase to better match the index.

\hypertarget{likelihood-profiles}{%
\subsection{Likelihood Profiles}\label{likelihood-profiles}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Likelihood profiles were conducted for natural mortality ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), steepness ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) and the log of R0 (unfished recruitment) by fixing these parameters across a range of values and continuing to estimate the remaining parameters assuming the base model framework. All models in this section use the \textbf{post-STAR} base models.

The profiles for natural mortality in the southern base model (Figures \ref{fig:m-profile}, \ref{fig:m-depl}, \ref{fig:m-spawn}, \ref{fig:m-recruits}, and \ref{fig:m-recdevs}) suggest that this parameter is reasonably well informed between a range of approximately 0.11 and 0.14. The profiles suggest a somewhat commonly observed phenomena of tension between the age data, which would suggest a lower natural mortality rate, and the length and index data, which tend to fit the data better with a higher value for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The notable exceptions to these generalizations include the NWFSC hook and line survey index, which fits the data better with a considerably lower {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and the commercial fisheries data (hook-and-line, and setnet), which also fit the data better with a lower {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Intuitively, spawning output increased with lower natural mortality rate estimates, while the estimate of relative stock status was more pessimistic, while the converse was true (lower spawning output, more optimistic stock status estimates) with higher {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values.

A profile of steepness was conducted on values ranging from 0.30 to 0.90 in 0.10 increments. The resulting likelihood profiles (by component, and by component and fleet) are shown as Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}, while model trajectories (spawning output, relative depletion, age-0 recruits and recruitment deviations) are shown as Figures \ref{fig:h-spawn}, \ref{fig:h-depl}, \ref{fig:h-recruits}, and \ref{fig:h-recdevs}. The likelihood profiles show that the overall best fit to the data is associated with high steepness values, although the data were generally uninformative above steepness values of 0.5. Overall the length data were not very informative, and there were some odd changes in the likelihood in some fleets at very low (0.3) steepness values. Similarly the age data were only marginally informative, and suggested higher steepness values in general. Most of the indices also suggested higher steepness values, particularly the NWFSC hook and line survey index, although the Rec PC index had a significantly better fit at lower steepness values. Predictably, spawning output scaled down with higher steepness values and up with lower values, however the estimate of stock status in 2021 varied relatively little across the range of values. Interestingly the most optimistic runs with respect to relative stock status were both the highest and the lowest values in the profile, although the overall difference was negligible for the ending year. The higher steepness runs were more pessimistic with respect to historical (late 1980s through the early 2000s) stock status.

A profile on the log of unfished recruitment (Ln R0) was conducted on values ranging from 6.2 to 6.9 (the base model estimate in base model was 6.66). In general, age data was better fit by the model with lower values of R0, survey data (as well as recruitment via likelihood penalties) were better fit by higher R0 values, and the cumulative fit to length data was best close to the base model estimate (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The components by fleet were variable in the cases of length composition data, in which the commercial hook and line fishery and the Rec PC data fit better with lower R0 values, while the remaining fleets fit better with higher R0 values or were non-informative (Figures \ref{fig:r0-depl}, \ref{fig:r0-spawn}, \ref{fig:r0-recruits}, and \ref{fig:r0-recdevs}). Spawning output is estimated to be greater with the higher R0 values and lower with the lower R0 values, as a result of corresponding model changes in the estimate of the natural mortality rate (which is estimated to be much lower in the low R0 model). This results in the lower R0 runs also being more pessimistic, as the lower R0 runs were associated with considerably lower natural mortality rates. Additional profiles in which M is fixed may be helpful in evaluating model performance across many of the key model parameters.

\subsection{Retrospective Analysis}\label{retrospective-analysis}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

All models in this section use the \textbf{post-STAR} base model.

A five year retrospective analysis was conducted on the southern base model by sequentially removing data, beginning with data from the year 2020. Figures \ref{fig:retro-spawnb}, \ref{fig:retro-bratio}, \ref{fig:retro-recruits}, and \ref{fig:retro-recdevs} show the estimated spawning output, the estimated depletion, and recruitment deviation estimates. The greatest impact was the declining estimate of the strength of the 2016 year class, similar to the northern model, with the interesting result that with the loss of only 1-3 years of data the model attributes greater recruitment to 2015 relative to the base model, with variable responses among other recruitment estimates. This change is associated with an increasingly pessimistic perception of stock status, although the overall scaling of spawning output is relatively modest. This shift is understandably associated with the change in population trajectory as data supporting strong recent recruitment are removed. Beyond this shift, this analysis does not suggest that there are substantive retrospective patterns (Table \ref{tab:retro}). Note that all composition data weights were held constant at the base model values during each run.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Uncertainty around the magnitude of historical vermilion rockfish catches may be higher in this region, as some accounts suggest considerably higher historical catches than estimated in the 2010 catch reconstruction.

The primary fishery-independent survey for west coast groundfish, the NWC WCGBTS, does not sample rocky habitats where most vermilion rockfish are found, and thus does not provide a robust index of abundance (and was excluded from this assessment). The NWFSC hook and line survey provides demographic and relative abundance data throughout the Southern California Bight, with the exception of some state closed areas.

While recent age data are robust, based primarily on the NWFSC hook-and-line survey, historical age data (both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) are very limited. The likelihood profiles suggest a somewhat commonly seen pattern of tension among data sources, with age data suggesting a lower natural mortality rate and length data (as well as most index data) suggesting a higher {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Natural mortality appears to be reasonably well estimated but is still uncertain, and seems to have the greatest influence on scaling the relative biomass and stock trajectory.

The model estimates a series of very low recruitment events through the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period in which many other rockfish in this region experienced high levels of recruitment. Recruitment patterns in more recent years generally follow those for other stocks. It is possible that selectivity patterns changed, data are biased, model misspecification, or unknown ecosystem interactions could be responsible for this pattern.

\section{Harvest Projections and Decision Tables}\label{harvest-projections-and-decision-tables}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the post-STAR base model, with the forecast projections presented in Table \ref{tab:projectionES}. The total catches in 2021 and 2022 are set to the projected catch from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) by sector and model region, i.e., allocated north and south of $34^\circ 27^\prime N$ in California.

Uncertainty in the decision table forecasts is based upon the three alternative states of nature agreed upon during the STAR panel, reflecting results of a bivariate likelihood profile over natural mortality and steepness. The low state of nature assumes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = .1125 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.675, and the high state of nature assumes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.1475 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.875.

The buffers between OFL and ABC were calculated assuming a category 2 stock, with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 1.0 and a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45. For reference, the base model predicted {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is 0.258, calculated using the asymptotic standard error of the predicted OFL in 2021. Alternative catch streams (rows in the table) include {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 1.0 with a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.4, and removals of long-term equilibrium catch at the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(F_{SPR=50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} harvest rate with and without a buffer assuming {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 1.0 and a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45. The buffer multiplier with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(p^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45 ranges from 0.874 in 2023 ramping to 0.803 in 2032.

The base model with the default harvest control rule catches (p*=0.45, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=1) predicts an increasing stock over the period from 2023-2032. Forecasts based on the alternative catch streams project that the stock will remain above the target threshold of 40\% through 2032 given either the base model or ``high'' states of nature (Table \ref{tab:DecisionES}). Given the low state of nature, the stock remains below the target threshold of 40\% throughout the 12-year forecast under all four catch scenarios.

The STAT cautions that the GMT projections for catches in 2021-2022 (210 mt per year) exceed the maximum sustainable yield according to both proxies ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(B_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) as well as the MSY value based on the estimated value of steepness (Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). The southern California stock is above target biomass, so the GMT catch levels are unlikely to result in significant stock declines over a 2-year period. However, similar catch levels would exceed the overfishing limits (OFL) for 2023 and beyond (Table \ref{tab:projectionES}), and would be unsustainable in the long term. Given recent and projected near-term exploitation levels, and especially if vermilion and sunset rockfish continue to be managed as part of the minor shelf rockfish complex, the STAT recommends regular monitoring of total mortality for these two species to avoid excessive stock depletion and potential loss of yield.

\subsection{Regional Management and Spatial Management Considerations}\label{regional-management-and-spatial-management-considerations}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Over the last several decades, spatially explicit management measures at both the state and federal/management council level have been implemented to achieve a wide range of marine resource and fishery management objectives. Depth restrictions to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) and the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) are key among those, as are the suite of total and partial exclusion of commercial and recreational fishing activities in the California statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). While the former are associated with explicit fisheries management objectives, the latter have a suite of ecological and economic objectives, most of which are not specific to, nor integrated across, the fisheries management arena. Despite this, both types of spatial management measures are expected to result in various biological, ecological, and socioeconomic effects within and adjacent to their boundaries. All of these effects have the potential to influence the nature and quality of the data used to inform stock assessments of species that reside in these areas, including vermilion rockfish.

Regardless of the management objective, spatial closures are expected to increase the spatial heterogeneity in abundance and size or age structure of fished stocks. This greater spatial variability can complicate the assumptions made in stock assessment models, particularly the assumption that the densities and demographic structure of assessed populations are relatively homogeneous, at least across predictable habitat types such as bathymetric gradients or substrate types {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Punt and Methot 2004, Field et al. 2006, Berger et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Although a wide range of factors above and beyond spatial management measures can also lead to violations of those assumptions, and the challenge is intuitively less problematic for populations with high movement rates and/or high population turnover, the challenge can be particularly important for longer lived populations with lower movement rates. The challenge can best be summarized by the result that the more effective MPAs or other closed areas are at protecting populations within them, the more likely it is that traditional assessment approaches will be biased or more uncertain.

If the spatial closures also prevent fisheries independent surveys from evaluating the relative abundance and demographic structure of managed populations, the challenges in developing robust population models, and thus robust management advice, become even more severe. While spatially explicit assessment models provide a means of more explicitly addressing these challenges, such models are computationally intensive, require robust data from the specific areas being modeled, and may also require detailed information regarding movement and dispersal rates {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(McGilliard et al. 2014, Berger et al. 2017, Cadrin 2020, Punt et al. 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Moreover, the complexity of these spatial models increases substantially if the size and location of closed areas changes over time, as many of the more ``fisheries management based'' closures (e.g., RCAs) have in California groundfish fisheries. Thus, such approaches may be less feasible for more data limited stocks, such as northern and southern vermilion rockfish, at least in the near term. However, the fact that both the northern and southern assessment models are informed by fishery-independent surveys that include habitats both inside and outside area closures provides some hope for greater recognition of spatial factors in future assessments.

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\tagstructbegin{tag=L}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the vermilion/sunset rockfish complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within a single species and also between the two species. Little biological data for south of Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed to better under biological parameters.

    \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
  \end{itemize}

  \tagstructend
\item
  Take a closer look at historical catch reconstructions and all other historical data sources.
\item
  Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including a hierarchical structure and random effects. The CCFRP survey is the only fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available, and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored since 2007.
\item
  Continue to investigate the most appropriate model structure for the NWFSC HL survey index. The NWFSC HL survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat in the Southern California Bight. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey index, given its expansion into the CCA, also independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey. Increased spatiotemporal sampling around Point Conception would aid in identifying stock boundaries.
\item
  Utilize existing ROV survey data sources

\subsection{MRFSS Dockside Index of Abundance}\label{mrfss-index}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\textbf{MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index, 1980-1999}

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of the recreational CPFV fishing fleet. No MRFSS CPUE data are available for the years 1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. Sampling of California CPFVs north of Point Conception was further delayed, and CPFV samples in 1993 and 1994 are limited to San Luis Obispo County. For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series was truncated at 1999 due to sampling overlap with the onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for the same vessel).

Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers being interviewed. The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials (``Identifying Trips in RecFIN'').

\textbf{MRFSS CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

Trips recorded with a primary area fished in Mexico or in bays, e.g., San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition. For indices representing only north of Point Conception, the years 1993-1994 were excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2004)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} filtering approach was used to predict the probability of catching vermilion rockfish, based on the species composition of the sampler examined catch in a given trip. Prior to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (present in at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model. The remaining 24 species all co-occurred with vermilion rockfish in at least one trip and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for species that are more likely to co-occur with vermilion rockfish, and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with vermilion rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:fig-sm-mrfss}). The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with vermilion rockfish include copper, greenspotted, bocaccio, and olive rockfishes and ocean whitefish, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were kelp bass, Pacific bonito, white croaker, California sheephead, and barred sandbass.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one species or species complex (``mixed trips'') can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2004)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} recommended including all trips above a threshold where the false negatives and false positives are equally balanced. However, this does not have any biological relevance and for this data set, and we assume that if a vermilion rockfish was landed, the anglers fished in appropriate habitat, especially given vermilion rockfish is strongly associated with rocky habitat.

Stephens and MacCall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2004)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch a vermilion rockfish based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a vermilion rockfish, given the catch composition, but caught at least one. The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence at which the rate of ``false positives'' equals ``false negatives'' of 0.31. The trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method including all the ``false positive'' trips, regardless of the probability of encountering vermilion rockfish. This assumes that if vermilion rockfish were caught, the anglers must have fished in appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is ``sampler-examined'' and the samplers are well trained in species identification.

The threshold probability that balances FP and FN excludes 5383 trips that did not catch a vermilion rockfish (84\% of the trips), and 308 trips (5\% of the data) that caught a vermilion rockfish. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that catching a vermilion rockfish indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing effort occurred in habitat where vermilion rockfish occur. Only ``true negatives'' (the 5383 trips that neither caught vermilion rockfish, nor were predicted to catch them by the model) were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included 1043 trips, 70\% of which encountered vermilion rockfish. Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-mrfss} and \ref{tab:tab-year-mrfss}.

\textbf{MRFSS CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be ill-fitting. The proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) with a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore \textless3 nm, offshore \textgreater3 nm) factors were evaluated. For assessments north of Point Conception, two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte to Santa Cruz (``N'') and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo (``C''). For assessment models south of Point Conception, the region represents individual counties. Note that Santa Barbara county spans north and south of Point Conception, but all accessible fishing ports in Santa Barbara county are south of Point Conception and vessels rarely (if ever) transit Point Conception. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss}).

The positive observations were modeled with a Lognormal distribution that was selected over a Gamma model by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 51.8, and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss}). The delta-GLM method allows selection of differing linear predictors between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits, a main effects model including NA was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and CNTY and WAVE and AREA X was fit for the Lognormal model (Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-mrfss}). Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-mrfss} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-mrfss}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 30\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-mrfss}) and the predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-mrfss} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-mrfss}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-mrfss}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-mrfss}).

\subsection{California CPFV Onboard Index of Abundance}\label{cpfv-index}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\textbf{California Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019}

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling program in 1999 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Monk et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows the protocols established in Reilly et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1998)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.\\
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for vermilion rockfish . Cal Poly has modified protocols reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at the level of a fisher's bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either CDFW or Cal Poly in 2020.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical in that the same protocols are followed. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index selectivity is mirrored to the recreational fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead) fish. Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length from CDFW sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and included in the length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model.

A number of filters are applied to these data. All of the Cal Poly data were QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the data from CDFW. Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data.

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution. Reefs were developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material (``Reef Delineation''). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts north of Point Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths (Figure \ref{fig:fig-depthfished-cpfvonboard}). The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger areas considered as a factor in the index.

We retained 14218 drifts for index standardization, with 5960 drifts encountering vermilion rockfish (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-cpfvonboard}).

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-cpfvonboard}, \ref{tab:tab-depth-cpfvonboard}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-cpfvonboard}.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-cpfvonboard}).

A Lognormal model was selected over a over a Gamma model for the positive observations by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 919.67, and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-cpfvonboard}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits (Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-cpfvonboard}), a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-cpfvonboard} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-cpfvonboard}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 58\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-cpfvonboard}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-cpfvonboard} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-cpfvonboard}. The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-cpfvonboard}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-cpfvonboard}).

\textbf{CRFS Dockside Private Boat Index}

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2018, were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e.~effort units are angler trips), angler-reported distance from shore (Area X: inside/outside of 3 nm), county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The sample size of the unfiltered private boat CPUE data is much larger than the crfspr CPFV data set, with 391,279 trips statewide, 120,655 in southern California (south of Point Conception), and 270,064 north of Point Conception.

\emph{CRFS Private Boat Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes} Records were limited to ``PR1'' sites, and only the hook-and-line gear type (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr}). Since this is a dockside index lacking precise fishing location information, we use the percent of groundfish within the catch from a trip as a proxy for retaining trips for index standardization. Similar to the CRFSS onboard index, we partitioned the data into areas north and south of Point Conception and applied the method separately to each data set.

Since 2005, the recreational fishery for shelf rockfish north of Point Conception has been closed from January through part of April and May.Angler reported distance from shore had no samples in the ``outside 3 nm'' category (Area X = 2) from 2004-2011, but was retained in the index standardization due to the relaxation of depth restrictions beginning in 2017. We retained 11953 drifts for index standardization, with 6768 drifts encountering vermilion (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr}).

\emph{Northern California CRFS Private Boat Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-crfspr} and \ref{tab:tab-year-crfspr}. We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-crfspr}).

A Lognormal model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 893.86 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-crfspr}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-crfspr}), a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and AREA X was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and AREA X was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-crfspr} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-crfspr}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 43\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-crfspr}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-crfspr} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-crfspr}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-crfspr}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-crfspr}).

\subsubsection{Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook-and-Line Survey}\label{northwest-fisheries-science-center-hook-and-line-survey}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook-and-line survey (NWFSC HL) targeting shelf rockfish at fixed stations (`sites') in the Southern California Bight (Figure \ref{fig:spp-sites}). During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single `drop') for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g.~to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers × 5 hooks × 5 drops). Further details regarding the sampling frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

From 2004 through 2013, sampling was conducted only outside the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs). Beginning in 2014, 40 sites inside the CCAs were sampled, and roughly another 40 sites have been added in subsequent years inside the CCAs. The survey currently has 201 sites (79 inside and 122 outside the CCAs).

\textbf{Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook-and-Line Survey Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

Vermilion is one of the most commonly encountered species in the NWFSC hook-and-line survey {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Harms?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} (Figure \ref{fig:spp-sites}). Sites considered for an abundance index were limited to those that have caught at least 1 vermilion rockfish over the period 2004-2018 (circles in Figure \ref{fig:spp-sites}). Only 14 sites were identified as catching no vermilion over the entire sampling period. Sample sizes by depth and year can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-depth-nwfschl} and \ref{tab:tab-year-nwfschl}. Note that depth was used as a continuous variable (second-order polynomial) in the model, and depth bins were created for descriptive purposes and data exploration only.

\emph{Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook-and-Line Survey Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

The STAT explored alternative model structures to generate a standardized index of relative abundance. This included alternative response variables (catch in weight, catch in numbers, presence/absence), levels of aggregation (hook, drop, or site), probability distributions (binomial, negative binomial, lognormal, delta-gamma, and logit-normal), and covariates (year, site number, depth, distance to port, area, inside/outside CCA). Preliminary analyses showed that trends in the annual proportion of positive hooks were very similar to trends in catch rate per drop or site. Posterior predictive checks of annual means and standard deviations identified the logit-normal model as the most appropriate error distribution. The final model included covariate terms for year, site number, drop number, a second-order depth term, and a normally-distributed random effect for each observation.

Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the final logit model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-nwfschl} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-nwfschl}). The model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the \textasciitilde50\% zeroes in the data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-nwfschl}). The predicted marginal effects from the final logit normal model can be found in Figure \ref{fig:marginal-nwfschl}. The marginal depth effect represents the influence of depth on the proportion of vermilion after accounting for site effects. A model run without the site effect confirms that that depth follows the expected pattern observed in the data, i.e.~a peak near 145 m (Figure \ref{fig:marginal2-nwfschl}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-nwfschl}), when compared to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE, declines slightly more from 2008-2012, with a significant increase after 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-nwfschl}).

The expansion of the survey area into the CCAs after 2014 limits exploration of year/area interactions in the model. The STAT adopted an approach similar to that used for the 2019 assessment of cowcod {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick and He 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Specifically, because site effects (both inside and outside the CCA) are constant over time in the index, selectivity for the index is estimated using composition data that represents all areas (2014-2019, inside and outside the CCAs). Not wanting to lose length and age compositions prior to 2014, these data are moved to a `dummy' fleet in the assessment model, and allowed to have a different selectivity curve due to differences in size composition inside and outside the CCAs {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Keller et al. 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This treatment of the data, although not ideal, was seen as preferable to development of two separate indices.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

In 2003, the NWFSC expanded the ongoing slope survey to include the continental shelf. This survey, referred to in this document as the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBT Survey or WCGBTS), is conducted annually. It uses a r andom-grid design covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m from late-May to early-October {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Keller et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Four chartered industry vessels are used in most years.

*\textbf{WCGBTS Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

Vermilion rockfish were found during the WCGBTS, mainly off the coast of California. Haul-level information collected during the survey was extracted from the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data}{Northwest Fisheries Science Center database}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} using code within the \texttt{nwfscSurvey} package, providing information on catches (kg), vessel, year, latitude (decimal degrees), and area swept (hectares).

Just two records with positive tows were located north of the California-Oregon border and were excluded from this analysis. Most of the positive tows were found in waters less than 200 m depth (Table @ref\{tab:ndepth\}), and thus, this analysis was truncated to waters with a depth of 300 m or less. Positive tows were found south of 32.45 decimal degrees, which was used to represent the California-Mexico border. This left, fifty-eight positive tows north of 34.50 decimal degrees and one hundred twenty-three positive tows south of 34.50 decimal degrees. Positive encounters were just 7 and 15 percent of all tows for these two areas, respectively.

\emph{WCGBTS Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-depth-wcgbts} and \ref{tab:tab-year-wcgbts}. We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model.

A Lognormal distribution was selected over a Gamma for the positive observation GLM. The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-wcgbts}), a main effects model including YEAR and LAT bin was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and DEPTH bin and LAT bin was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-wcgbts} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-wcgbts}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 84\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-wcgbts}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-wcgbts} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-wcgbts}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-wcgbts}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-wcgbts}).
