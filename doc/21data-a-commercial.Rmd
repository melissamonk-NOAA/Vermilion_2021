### Commercial Landings and Discards

*Commercial Landings Prior to 1916*

For landings estimates prior to 1916, we based our reconstruction on the total 
rockfish catches reported in a summary of early California fisheries landings by 
Sette and Fielder [-@Sette1928] for the years 1888, 1892, 1895, 1899, 1904, 1908 
and 1915.  No rockfish were reported for 1888, thus we assumed no catches for that
year and interpolated the catches between 0 and the 1892 catches (total of 834 
tons) reported.  Similarly, catches between the reported years were interpolated 
assuming a straight linear trend between the years reported.  We used a 
ratio-estimator derived from the catch reconstruction fraction of vermilion 
rockfish in total rockfish landings for the 1916 to 1919 period (the ratio for
a comparable five year period was nearly identical).  We apportioned the catches 
north and south of Point Conception based on ratio estimators that used the same 
assumptions used to apportion catches in the reconstruction time period (1916-1968).
The catch reconstruction estimates indicated that vermilion made up slightly under 
1% of the total rockfish catches during the early (1916-1919) time period, although 
the estimates indicate a slightly larger fraction (1.5%) of total catches south of 
Conception relative to the fraction of total catches to the north (0.9%).  However, 
it is likely that the reconstruction is overestimating the fraction of smaller and/or 
more deeply distributed species relative to larger, shallower species as the 
reconstruction is based on the species composition data collected from market 
category samples in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The fishery has been shown
to have progressed over time from a shallower, more nearshore distribution of 
effort to one in which deeper and more offshore waters were targeted [@Miller2014]. 
The notion that vermilion catches may have been greater is also consistent with 
the recognition by Roedel [-@Roedel1948] that during the 1930s and 1940s vermilion 
were “One of the more important commercial species, it is one of three leading 
species in Southern California." However, by the time of that report, vermilion 
represented five to eight percent of the southern California catch (based on 
Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010]), much more than at the beginning of the time 
series.  Future efforts to improve historical catch reconstructions by accounting 
for the shift in effort over time to deeper waters should continue to be flagged 
as a research need. 


*Commercial Landings, 1916-2020*

For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction 
database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010b]. 
Landings in this database are divided into trawl, ‘non-trawl’, and ‘unknown’ gear 
categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] were 
assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al. includes Santa 
Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports in San 
Luis Obispo County (north of Point Conception). To allocate catches from Region 
6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used 
by Dick et al. [-@Dick2007] for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, 
port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were 
used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of
Point Conception (Table XXX). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported 
at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition 
catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the 
absence of port-specific species composition data. 

Years with no data were imputed 
using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations 
(Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from 
known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were 
allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, 
total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by 
Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010b], and assigned to the assessment areas north and 
south of Point Conception, and either trawl or ‘non-trawl’ gear types. To 
approximate California landings from 1900 to 1915, we used a linear interpolation 
starting from zero metric tons in 1899 to the amount of ‘non-trawl’ catch, by 
area, in 1916 (Table XXX). Since hook and line gears catch the majority of 
commercially-caught vermilion rockfish, we assigned estimated catch in the 
‘non-trawl’ category to the hook and line fleet in the assessment model.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) 
incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into 
the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (“fish tickets”), 
including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish 
landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition 
samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 
‘ratio estimator’ landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the 
CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available
landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes. Since commercial 
port sampling south of Point Conception started later, ratio estimates were used 
in some southern California port complexes through 1983. See Appendix A of Dick 
et al. [-@Dick2007] and Pearson et al. [-@Pearson2008; pp. 8 and 15-16] for 
further details.
