## Model Specifications

A decision was made by the STAT after discussions with the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s Groundfish Management Team and Groundfish Advisory Panel to model the areas north and south of Point Conception independently for a number of reasons. This included a discussion of the assumed higher densities of sunset rockfish south of Point Conception and the general decline in vermilion rockfish density as latitude increases.  The preliminary exploration of length data also suggested that the size composition of landed fish north and south of Point Conception differed in a number of fleets. The STAT did maintain consistency across the two models when the data supported the decisions, i.e., maintaining the same recreational and commercial fleet structures and sharing biological data from the more data-rich southern assessment.

The commercial fleet catches includes dead discards, which were a small percent of the overall landings in both areas (averaging 7.4 mt coastwide since 2015, although increasing since 2017). In addition, there were very little data available from WCGOP. There are four recreational fleets representing retained and assumed-dead discard catches for the PC and PR fleets.  This follows the same practice as a number of other recent rockfish stock assessments in recent years, where the ability to accurately estimate a retention curve is masked by depth-dependent mortality rates. Vermilion rockfish is a desirable species in the recreational fleet and the majority of available lengths from discarded fish from the CDFW and Cal Poly observer programs were regulatory discards from trips when the groundfish fishery was closed and were not representative of discards in the recreational fleet.

The specifications of the California models north and south of Point Conception are very similar.  The major differences between the two models are the availability of fishery-independent data sources that are region specific. 

The fishery-independent data used to estimate the weight-length relationship and the maturity ogive were mainly derived from data collected south of Point Conception, and the parameters were shared across both models.

The `r Spp` assessment `r params$model` of Point Conception (\PtC) off the coast of California is assessed using a two-sex model with sex-specific growth.

The model assumed seven fishing fleets with removals beginning in `r startyr`: 

*Commercial*: There are three commercial fleets; hook-and-line, trawl, and net. 
All of the commercial fleets represented landed dead catch and assumed dead discards.

*Recreational*: There are four recreational fleets.  Each of the PC and PR modes have 
separate fleets for retained and discarded catch.  This decision was driven by the 
length compositions between retained 
and discarded fish (with discarded fish on average smaller than retained fish).

*Fishery-Dependent Surveys*:  There are four fishery-dependent survey fleets north 
of Point Conception; 1) the MRFSS CPFV dockside survey, 2) Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard observer survey, 3)CDFW/Cal Poly onboard observer survey, and 4) CRFS PR1 dockside survey.


*Research*: There are three research fleets; 1) Abrams conditional-length-at-age data, 
2) NWFSC WCGBT survey data, and 3) SWFSC groundfish ecology survey data.

### Additional Specifications

```{asis, echo = model.area=='NCA'}
Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for all fleets. Selectivities were estimated for the commercial hook-and-line fleet, commercial trawl fleet, and the commercial net fleet.  Selectivity was estimated for the recreational PC fleet, recreational PC discard fleet and the Recreational PR fleet.  There were no length data available for the recreational PR fleet, and it mirrors the selectivity of the recreational PC discard fleet.
Selectivity for the recreational PC onboard index of abundance is mirrored to the recreational 
PC fleet as they share the same length composition.  The Abrams research selectivity mirrors the 
commercial hook-and-line fleet. The STAT explored mirroring this data set to the recreational PC fleet, but the length composition was more representative of the commercial fleet. The Abrams dataset was too sparse and only collected over a two year period.  Hook-and-line gear was the 
dominant collection method for teh SWFSC groundfish ecology survey and is mirrored to the commercial hook-and-line fleet.

Selectivity parameters were estimated for all fishery-independent data sources.


The recreational PC and PR fleets applied three time blocks for selectivity:  `r startyr` - `r time_blocks$Yr[1]-1`, `r time_blocks$Yr[1]` - `r time_blocks$Yr[2]-1`, - `r time_blocks$Yr[2]` - `r endyr`. All commercial fleet selectivity was constant across model years `r startyr` - `r endyr`.

The commercial fleet selectivity applied three time blocks: 1975-1988, 1990-2001, and 2002-2020. The commercial selectivity blocks for the hook-and-line fleet were fixed to be asymptotic, while the dome-shaped selectivity was explored for the commercial net fishery. The recreational fleet selectivity applied two time blocks 1975-2000 and 2001-2020, and selectivities were allowed to be dome-shaped.  A number of regulatory changes occurred around 1999-2002, including depth closures, changes to the number of hooks, and the implementation of the CCAs.

The length composition data for some years and fleets was small, and may not be 
representative of the total catch. Length composition data were removed from the 
model if fewer than 10 fish were measured in a given 
year and fleet. Initial input sample sizes were also capped at x00 for each set of length composition data.

The time-series of landings begins in 1875 for the commercial fleet and in 1916 for 
the recreational fleet.  This captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is 
assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.

The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-70, where age 70 is the ‘plus-group.’ 
There are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 28. 
The population length bins and the length composition length bins are set at 2-cm bins from 
fish 10-70 cm fork length.

The first year of recruitment deviations begins in `r `min(model$recruitpars$Yr)`, with 1963 as the last year 
of early recruitment deviations with no bias adjustment and 1980 as the first year 
with full bias adjustment.  

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16.00 developed by 
Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@Methot2013]. This most recent 
version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older 
model versions. The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 
1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

Electronic SS model files including the data, control, starter, and forecast files can be 
found on the 
[PFMC's website](https://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/).


### Model Parameters


### Priors

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` and $\sigma$=0.15) is retained.  


### Data Weighting
Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for 
the base model were tuned by the "Francis method," based on equation TA1.8 in Francis 
[-@Francis2011], and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing 
the residuals in the model’s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean 
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their 
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed 
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models 
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0. 

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and 
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the 
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. Additionally, weighting 
using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) 
that scales the input sample size, was explored. However, all estimates of the ratio of 
$\theta/(1+\theta)$ were greater than 0.99, which indicates the models is trying to tune 
the sample size as high as possible.  Given this result, the STAT chose not to further explore 
the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting. As a note, there is a bug in SS Version 3.30.16.00 that 
prevents the number of estimated weights from being larger than the number of fleets.  This was 
fixed in SS Version 3.30.16.01 and this version was only used for exploration of the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting.

The STAT explored both McAllister-Ianelli and Francis data weighting methods with the 
pre-STAR base model.
