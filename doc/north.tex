Vermilion rockfish range from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to central Baja California at depths of 6 m to 436 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. However, they are most commonly found from central Oregon to Punta Baja, Mexico {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} at depths of 50 m to 150 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Hyde and Vetter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} describe vermilion rockfish as residents of shallower depths (\textless100 m) than sunset rockfish. Adult fish tend to cluster on high relief rocky outcrops {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and kelp forests {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. North of Point Conception, some adults are shallower, living in caves and cracks {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Vermilion rockfish have shown high site fidelity {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hannah and Rankin 2011 (only tagged 1 vermilion); Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and low average larval dispersal distance {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Lowe et al.~(2009) {[}Lowe2009{]} suggested vermilion rockfish to have a lower site fidelity than previously believed, but they acknowledged that their observations of movements to different depths may have been due to the reality of a shallower species and a deeper species. Approximate lifespan for vermilion rockfish is 60 years, with females living longer and growing larger than their male counterparts. 50\% are mature at 5 years and about 37 cm, with males probably maturing at shorter lengths than females {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Vermilion rockfish are viviparous, and release 63,000 to 2,600,000 eggs per season. In southern California, vermilion rockfish larvae are released between July and March. In central and northern California, this release occurs in September, December, and April-June {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Larval release in fall and winter is not common among other rockfish species. Hyde and Vetter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} suggest that low larval dispersal may be due to weak poleward flow of nearshore waters corresponding with peak vermilion larval release.

Young-of-the-year vermilion rockfish settle out of the plankton during two recruitment periods per year, first from February to April and a second from August to October, and settlement has been observed in May off southern California {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Larvae measure about 4.3 mm. Both young-of-the-year vermilion and sunset rockfish are mottled brown with areas of black, and older juveniles turn a mottled orange or red color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. S. Love et al. 2012)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Juvenile fish are found individually from 6 m to 36 m, living near sand and structures. After two months, juveniles travel deeper and live on low relief rocky outcrops and other structures {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Adult vermilion rockfish predominantly eat smaller fish, though sometimes they pursue euphausiids and other various macroplankton {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Phillips 1964)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Love {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} noted their diet to include octopus, salps, shrimps, and pelagic red crabs.

\emph{Population Structure and Complex Assessment Considerations}

This assessment represents the cryptic species pair vermilion rockfish (\emph{Sebastes miniatus}) and sunset rockfish (\emph{Sebastes crocotulus}). Hyde {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} found seven mirochondrial and two nuclear genes analysis suggested three species within the subgenus \emph{Rosicola}. Hyde et al.~ {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} described sunset rockfish as a distinct species noting depth separation of the adult populations of the two species using nine microsatellite loci. Sunset rockfish is distributed at depths greater than 50 fm (100 m) and are predominantly located south of Pt. Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$). Hyde and Budrick identified speciation using mtDNA assay and size microsatelite loci, respectively. The mtDNA analyses proved to be subject to introgression and mis-specification of sunset rockfish from mating between the two species post-divergence. Additional population clusters of vermilion were found north of Pt. Conception, but neither study detected population structure between Half Moon Bay, California and Brookings, OR {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009; Budrick 2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Vermilion and sunset rockfishes are morphologically very similar, with the most commonly cited differentiating feature being color. Hyde noted differences in three of six morphological parameters examined, but none of them can readily be used for field identification.

In all historical and current recreational and commercial catches, sunset and vermilion rockfish are both recorded as vermilion rockfish. Future studies, such as the one described below will provide data needed to compare biological parameters between the two species as well as habitats.

\emph{Ongoing Research (Provided by John Harms, NWFSC)}

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the Southern CA Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019. Funding for this project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for FY 2020 through a proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed. Some earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from the vermilion genome into the sunset genome, a portion of the sunset rockfish population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals during the prior research project. The current research has identified a robust suite of genetic markers within the nuclear genomes of the two species that definitively separates vermilion and sunset rockfish (including introgressed sunset rockfish), canary rockfish, first generation vermilion-sunset hybrids, and identifies emerging patterns of intraspecific stock structure within the two sister species.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships, and other biological characteristics will be identified. Using previously collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at 50\% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared. These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA work to evaluate whether introgressed sunset rockfish represent a biologically intermediate subform of the species complex. The effort also proposes to develop and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other information. The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community. If successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors, may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and management of cryptic species complexes. Though this project will only focus on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.

\subsection{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors (other than as inform relative abundance indices) or environmental factors into the assessment model, but a brief description of likely or potential ecosystem considerations are provided below.

vermilion/sunset rockfish are described as feeding on a wide range of both pelagic and benthic prey items, including forage fish species such as anchovies and mesopelagic fishes, squid, krill and octopus, as well as sporadically abundant pelagic organisms such as pyrosomes, salps and pelagic red crabs {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Phillips 1964; M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Interestingly, other rockfishes (either juvenile or adult stages) have not been documented as prey for vermilion, as they have been for other larger \emph{Sebastes} species such as cowcod, bocaccio and yelloweye rockfish. For the latter species, the idea of ``cultivation effects,'' in which adults crop down forage species that are potential competitors/predators of their own juveniles {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Walters2001?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, have been suggested by {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}Baskett, Yoklavich, and Love (2006)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. For example, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2006)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} found that in such scenarios there could be alternative stable states in which either the overfished species or the smaller prey species could dominate. While the sparse diet data for vermilion/sunset rockfish do not suggest such a process for this species complex, food habits data for vermilion/sunset are not robust, and the larger community processes on these rocky reef communities may also influence productivity and community composition regardless of the direct predation interactions. Pelagic and benthic juvenile vermilion and sunset rockfish are likely preyed upon by the same wide range of predators that prey on juveniles and adults of other rockfish species, including seabirds, piscivorous fishes, and marine mammals.\\
As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment, or cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for the vermilion/sunset rockfish complex, with only a modest apparent relationship to spawning output.\\
Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements of California Current food webs. Empirical estimates of recruitment from pelagic juvenile rockfish surveys have been used to inform incoming year class strength for some of these stocks, however vermilion and sunset rockfish are rarely encountered in these surveys. Specifically, only 47 of nearly 300,000 total juvenile \emph{Sebastes} encountered in juvenile surveys since 2001 were identified as vermilion or sunset rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Field2021?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Despite this, the results here suggest that at least a reasonable fraction of recruitment variability for sunset and vermilion rockfish is shared with other rockfish and groundfish stocks throughout the California Current, many of which also had strong year classes in 1984, 1999 and 2015. Previous studies have demonstrated that large-scale oceanographic drivers, such as the relative transport of subarctic waters (typically indicated by relative sea level) tend to relate to a substantial fraction of overall groundfish recruitment trends and ecosystem productivity {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}Schroeder et al. (2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Although it is feasible that ecosystem factors, the results of pre-recruit surveys for co-occurring species, or the results of other groundfish assessments might ultimately be used to forecast recruitment for more data-limited stocks such as vermilion/sunset, as suggested by {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson and Ward 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, such approaches would require more development and evaluation. Consequently, environmental factors are not explicitly considered in this assessment.

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in 1982, vermilion rockfish were managed through a regulatory process that included the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) along with either the California State Legislature or the Fish and Game Commission (FGC) depending on the sector (recreation or commercial) and fishery. With implementation of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, vermilion rockfish came under the management authority of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), and were managed as part of the \emph{Sebastes} complex. Because neither species had undergone rigorous stock assessment and did not compose a large fraction of the landings they were classified and managed as part of ``Remaining Rockfish'' under the larger heading of ``Other Rockfish'' (PFMC {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2004, 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}).

Since the early 1980s a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access with specific regulations designed for each component. Other regulatory actions for the general rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions, and cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial sectors - limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl. Harvest guidelines are also used to regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and commercial sectors.

In 2000, changes in the PFMC's rockfish management structure resulted in the discontinued use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and was replaced with three species groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes (January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221), of which vermilion rockfish are included in the minor shelf rockfish group.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major changes also occurred in the way that California managed its nearshore fishery. The Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), which was passed in 1998 by the California Legislature and enacted in 1999, required that the FGC adopt an FMP for nearshore finfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wilson-Vandenberg, Larinto, and Key 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Following adoption of the Nearshore FMP and accompanying regulations by the FGC in fall of 2002, the FGC adopted regulations in November 2002 which established a set of marine reserves around the Channel Islands in southern California (which became effective April 2003). The FGC also adopted a nearshore restricted access program in December 2002 (which included the establishment of a Deeper Nearshore Permit) to be effective starting in the 2003 fishing year.

Also, since the enactment of the MLMA, the Council and State in a coordinated effort developed and adopted various management specifications to keep harvest within the harvest targets, including seasonal and area closures (e.g.~the CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, minimum size limits, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal and area closures (e.g.~the RCAs and CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size limits to regulate the commercial fishery.

The state of California has adopted regulatory measures to manage the minor seashore shallow rockfish fishery based on the harvest guidelines set forth by the PFMC. The commercial open access and limited entry fixed gear sectors have undergone three different spatial management changes since 2000. Since 2005, both have managed the area south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ as one area. The open access commercial fishery is managed based on bimonthly allowable catches, that have ranged from 200 pounds to 1800 pounds per two months since 2000. From 2005 to 2018, the catch limits have doubled and are now set at 1200 pounds per two months (for all months) with March and April remaining closed. The limited entry fixed gear sector has followed the same pattern as the open access sector with bi-monthly limits and a doubling of the catch since 2005. The limited entry trawl fleet is managed on monthly limits on an annual basis. Since 2011, the limit has been 300 pounds per month for non-IFQ species. A history of California's commercial regulations from 2000-2018 can be found in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{appendix-a.-californias-commercial-fishery-regulations}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A 10-inch total length minimum size limit was implemented in 1999 for both species in the commercial fleet.

\textbf{Recreational Fisheries}

In March 1984 a recreational bag limig of 10 fish went into effect in California within the 20 fish aggregate. Significant regulatory changes in California's recreational sector began with a change from unlimited number of hooks and lines allowed prior to 2000 to no more than three hooks and one line per angler in 2000. Since 2001, the limit has been no more than two hooks and one line per angler. There is no size limit in the recreational fishery for vermilion rockfish.

California also began spatial management, including area closures, and depth restrictions for the recreational fleet in 2000. In general, the recreational season north of Point Conception extends from April to December, and south of Point Conception from March to December. In the area that vermilion rockfish are most commonly landed, from Monterey to Morro Bay, the maximum depth open to recreational fishing has been between 30 and 40 fathoms until 2017. In 2017 the depth restrictions were eased by 10 fathoms, opening up fishing depths along the central California coast that had not been open consistently since 2002. In both 2017 and 2018, the deepest 10 fathoms was closed prior to the prescribed season in December due to high by-catch rates of yelloweye rockfish, one of two rockfish species that are still overfished. A full history of the recreational regulations relating to the spatial management of the fleet can be found frog. Beginning on January 1, 2021 CDFW implemented a five-fish sub-bag limit for `vermilionvermilion rockfish rockfish that is not accounted for in this stock assessment.

\textbf{Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCA)} In 2001, two area closures {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36132\&inline}{``Cowcod Conservation Areas''}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were implemented to reduce fishing mortality of cowcod, originally prohibiting bottom-fishing deeper than 20 fm. Effective 2019, retention of nearshore and shelf rockfish (excluding cowcod) is allowed in depths shallower than 40 fm. The larger of the two areas (CCA West) is a 4200 square mile area west of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. A smaller area (CCA East) is about 40 miles offshore of San Diego, and covers about 100 square miles.

\textbf{Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCA)} In 2002 the PFMC established trawl- and non-trawl area closures known as the Rockfish Conservation Areas. These closed areas are gear-specific, and have seasonally changing boundaries to help reduce fishing mortality.

The contribution of vermilion rockfish to the shelf rockfish OFLs is currently derived from the data-poor Depletion Corrected Average Catch model {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(E. J. Dick and MacCall 1994)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A 2005 assessment was not accepted for management and a 2013 data-moderate assessment was not reviewed by the STAR panel due to insufficient time.

Total mortality for vermilion rockfish was obtaid from the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/api/v1/source/observer.gemm_fact/selection.xlsx}{GEMM}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} report {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Somers et al. 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The coastwide management of the shelf rockfish complex is split at Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$). Therefore, the northern California vermilion rockfish model contains a portion of the management area from Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$) to the California-Oregon border ($42^\circ 00^\prime N$). The southern California vermilion rockfish contains the area within the southern management area (south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$) south of Pt. Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$).

The total mortality of the nearshore rockfish south complex has been above the OFL in all years (2011-2019) north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$, and above the OFL south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ from 2015-2019. Total mortality estimates from the NMFS NWFSC are not yet available for 2020 (Table \ref{tab:management}). Vermilion rockfish total mortality was on average 63\% (range 59\%-69\%) of the total shelf rockfish south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ total mortality from 2011-2016. Vermilion rockfish decreased from 28\% to 4\% of the total contribution to the shelf rockfish complex north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ from 2011-2019 with a noticeable decline from 23\% to 7\% from 2016 to 2017.

\emph{Commercial Landings Prior to 1916}

For landings estimates prior to 1916, we based our reconstruction on the total rockfish catches reported in a summary of early California fisheries landings by Sette and Fielder {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1927)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the years 1888, 1892, 1895, 1899, 1904, 1908 and 1915. No rockfish were reported for 1888, thus we assumed no catches for that year and interpolated the catches between 0 and the 1892 catches (total of 834 tons) reported. Similarly, catches between the reported years were interpolated assuming a straight linear trend between the years reported. We used a ratio-estimator derived from the catch reconstruction fraction of vermilion rockfish in total rockfish landings for the 1916 to 1919 period (the ratio for a comparable five year period was nearly identical). We apportioned the catches north and south of Point Conception based on ratio estimators that used the same assumptions used to apportion catches in the reconstruction time period (1916-1968). The catch reconstruction estimates indicated that vermilion made up slightly under 1\% of the total rockfish catches during the early (1916-1919) time period, although the estimates indicate a slightly larger fraction (1.5\%) of total catches south of Conception relative to the fraction of total catches to the north (0.9\%). However, it is likely that the reconstruction is overestimating the fraction of smaller and/or more deeply distributed species relative to larger, shallower species as the reconstruction is based on the species composition data collected from market category samples in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The fishery has been shown to have progressed over time from a shallower, more nearshore distribution of effort to one in which deeper and more offshore waters were targeted {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The notion that vermilion catches may have been greater is also consistent with the recognition by Roedel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1948)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} that during the 1930s and 1940s vermilion were ``One of the more important commercial species, it is one of three leading species in Southern California.'' However, by the time of that report, vermilion represented five to eight percent of the southern California catch (based on Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), much more than at the beginning of the time series. Future efforts to improve historical catch reconstructions by accounting for the shift in effort over time to deeper waters should continue to be flagged as a research need.

\emph{Commercial Landings, 1916-2020}

For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Stephen Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl,' and `unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al.~includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports in San Luis Obispo County (north of Point Conception). To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table XXX). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data.

Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception, and either trawl or `non-trawl' gear types. To approximate California landings from 1900 to 1915, we used a linear interpolation starting from zero metric tons in 1899 to the amount of `non-trawl' catch, by area, in 1916 (Table XXX). Since hook and line gears catch the majority of commercially-caught vermilion rockfish, we assigned estimated catch in the `non-trawl' category to the hook and line fleet in the assessment model.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes. Since commercial port sampling south of Point Conception started later, ratio estimates were used in some southern California port complexes through 1983. See Appendix A of Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and Pearson et al.~{[}-{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}Pearson, Erwin, and Key (2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}; pp.~8 and 15-16{]} for further details.

\emph{Commercial length and age composition data}

Biological data from the commercial fisheries that landed vermilion rockfish were extracted from CALCOM on frog. The CALCOM length composition data were catch-weighted to ``expanded'' length the raw length composition data. The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figures @ref(fig:len-data-COM\_HKL)-@ref(fig:len-data-COM\_NET) and Table \ref{tab:length-sample-size}. Descriptions and details of the length composition data are in the above section for each fleet or survey.

Commercial discard length compositions from \Gls{wcgop} were provided on 17 Nov 2020 by Andi Stephens (NWFSC). Only 224 vermilion were measured from 2004-2018 and were not considered for use in the assessment.

Input sample sizes for commercial length composition varied depending on the available data source Otoliths collected from commercial fisheries north of Pt. Conception were provided and aged, but not used in the assessment due to low annual sample sizes.

\emph{Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003}

MRFSS estimates of California recreational landings from 1980-1989 and 1993-2003\\
were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://www.recfin.org/}{RecFIN}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The MRFSS survey design included stratification by species (sunset rockfish were not recognized at the time), subregion (northern and southern California), 2-month `wave,' water area (e.g.~within or beyond three miles from shore), and fishing mode (party/charter and private/rental boats, plus various shore modes).

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) missing estimates of catch in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, 2) a change in the spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, and 3) a hiatus in sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode north of Point Conception. The STAT attempted to address each of these issues, as described below. CRFS estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are included in the MRFSS catch estimate tables.

The MRFSS estimated catch in numbers of fish and converted these to catch in weight using estimates of average fish weight {[}kg{]} from the same stratum. When a stratum contained an estimate of catch in numbers but was missing an average weight, the estimate of catch in weight for that stratum was omitted (or sometimes assigned a zero value) in the database. To correct these errors, the STAT first identified strata with positive catch in numbers but missing or zero values for catch in weight. Catch in weight for these strata was then estimated by imputing a value of average weight based on the mean of the reported average weights in the same year and subregion. These factors had a greater influence on average weight than boat mode (Figure X). The effect of this correction was relatively minor for vermilion rockfish overall (\textasciitilde1\% increase in total catch by weight, 1980-2004). However, 70\% of missing catch in weight occurred over the years 2001-2004, with differences in individual year/mode/subregion combinations sometimes exceeding 10-20\%.

MRFSS catch estimates for California were spatially stratified into two subregions, ``Southern California'' (subregion 1) and ``Northern California'' (subregion 2). During the 1990-1992 statewide hiatus in sampling, the definitions of these two subregions changed. Specifically, San Luis Obispo (SLO) County was included in the southern region prior to the hiatus (i.e.~1980-1989) {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Witzig et al. 1992; Karpov, Albin, and Van Buskirk 1995)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, but moved to the northern subregion starting in 1993 (). In order to create a definition of spatial strata that is consistent and comparable over time, and one that is consistently divided near Point Conception, the STAT examined catch estimates from a separate study (Albin et al.~1993) that used a finer spatial resolution in the northern subregion (including SLO County). Over the period 1981-1986, the amount of vermilion rockfish landed in SLO County was found to be roughly equal to the amount of vermilion rockfish landed in all California counties north of SLO County (Table X). Therefore, to approximate catches north and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the `southern' subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by an amount equal to the northern subregion catch during the same period, and doubled the northern subregion catch. On average, this `moves' the estimated SLO County catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series.

As noted above, MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues. The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the party/charter (PC) boat mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County. To produce catch estimates for the missing subregion/mode/year combinations, we used linear interpolation. Shore modes were a minor component of the vermilion catch and therefore combined with catches from the private (PR) boat mode into a single fleet. Specifically, catches were aggregated by subregion (adjusted as described above), year, and mode, and endpoints for the interpolations were defined as 2-year averages to reduce the effects of interannual variability in catch on interpolated estimates.

MRFSS estimates of catch and discard after adjustment for missing average weights, changes in subregion definition, and sampling gaps are shown in Table X.

\emph{California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2020}

Estimates of recreational landings and discard since 2004 have been produced by the CRFS. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, with higher sampling rates and finer spatial and temporal resolution. Mortality estimates for the period 2005-2018 were queried from {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{www.recfin.org}{RecFIN}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Reported estimates are for southern California, all modes, and filtered to exclude fish caught in Mexican waters. Total recreational mortality estimates provided to RecFIN are also adjusted using species- and depth-specific discard mortality rates.

\emph{Discard mortality rates}

The recreational discard mortality rates for vermilion that were endorsed by the SSC and adopted by the PFMC in March 2017 are 20\% for 0-10 fm, 34\% for 10-20 fm, 50\% for 20-30 fm, and 100\% for greater than 30 fm.

Nearshore rates (jig and pole): 0-10 fm 20\%; 10-20 fm 34\%, \textgreater20 fm 100\%

\emph{Recreational length composition data}

In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California (Año Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas) to include the entire California coast. Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \Gls{cpfv}s guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location: Humboldt State University; Bodega Marine Laboratories; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of California, Santa Barbara; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \Gls{mpa}s. Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth; since then, some have been retained for biological collections including otoliths and fin clips.

This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the survey are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion/sunset (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al.~{[}-Harms2008{]}.

Vermilion rockfish are not well sampled by the following studies we considered as possible data sources.

\emph{NWFSC Triennial Survey}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dark and Wilkins 1994)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

\emph{Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey}

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V \emph{Miller Freeman}. Partial survey coverage of the US West Coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

\emph{Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans}

The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{http://www.piscoweb.org/kelp-forest-study}{PISCO-UCSC}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, conducts a number of surveys to monitor the kelp forests, one of which is a kelp forest fish survey. PISCO has monitored fish population in the 0-20 m depth range as part of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) since 1998. Paired sites inside and outside MPAs are surveyed to monitor the long-term dynamics of the kelp forest ecosystem and provide insight into the effect of MPAs on kelp forest species. PISCO conducts the fish surveys from late July through September. At each site, benthic, midwater, and canopy scuba transects are conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 20 m depth. All divers are trained in species identification. Along each 30 m transect, divers enumerate all identifiable non-cryptic fish, and measure total length to the nearest centimeter. PISCO surveys are conducted by the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in central California and through the University of California Santa Barbara in southern California.

\emph{California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations}

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) surveys\ldots{} Vermilion rockfish cannot be identified morphologically in the ichthyoplankton samples. Thompson et al.~identified nine vermilion rockfish from genetic samples.

\emph{Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Survey}

Since 1983, the SWFSC has conducted an annual midwater trawl survey for pelagic juvenile rockfish and other groundfish in the Central California region of the California Current ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and references therein). Due to concerns about mesoscale abundance patterns and a need for greater spatial representation in the data, including some apparent strong differences in spatial distribution patterns in the early 2000s {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Hastie2007?}; \textbf{Ralston2013b?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, this survey was expanded to a broader spatial scale in the 2001-2004 period, and since 2004 most years have coastwide data from a combination of SWFSC, NWFSC and Cooperative Research surveys (see{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Field2017?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for more complete details regarding coastwide pre-recruit data, and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Sakuma2016?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Friedman2018?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for additional details and alternative applications of survey data).

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \ref{fig:reader1reader2}). Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described above. The same readers aged otoliths for both vermilion rockfish stock assessmetnt models. Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts (CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson, Stewart, and Punt 2012)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more experienced. The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} among the top three models was less than two. The best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard deviation for both readers.\\
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 selected the the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation (Figure \ref{fig:oldfish}). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence internal using this model (Figure \ref{fig:truereads}).\\
The latter model was selected for use in the assessment.

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.

For the current assessment, Melissa Head (NWFSC, pers. comm.) determined maturity for frog female vermilion rockfish caught by recent fishery-independent surveys. Two types of maturity determinations were provided, `biological maturity' and `functional maturity.' The former category includes ``juveniles exhibiting dummy runs (early vitellogenesis or yolk granules present in a small proportion of oocytes, some in early stages of cellular decay) and skip spawners (adults foregoing spawning in a given year)'' (M. Head, pers. comm.), while the latter excludes such cases. Separate logistic regressions were fit to each type of maturity determination as a function of fork length (Figure frog), estimating LMAT at frog cm (biological maturity) and frog cm (functional maturity), with slopes of frog and frog, respectively. The samples available from areas north of Pt. Conception were smaller fish and did not allow for estimates of separate maturity curves. Both California vermilion assessments assum the same maturity ogive.

The proportion of females classified as mature may be sensitive to the month of capture. frog

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT; {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\url{https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2018)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} functional regression model and is a commomly applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user.

We assumed the age of 54 years to represent the practical longevity (i.e., 90\% of the commonly seen maximum age of 60) for both females and males, though the absolute oldest age in OR was \textgreater60 years. In the larger biomass, higher sampled area of California, ages 80+ were even encountered. Empirical {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimators using the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered, but they produced unreasonably high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely explained by the fact that while vermilion rockfish have protracted longevity at {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Additionally, the FishLife {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Thorson2017?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimate was included, though, given the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} are also from methods using longevity, though the actual source of longevity in FishLife was unknown. Both California vermilion assessments used the Hamel prior {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, which is defined as a lognormal with mean {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(ln\frac{5.4}{A_{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and SE = 0.4384343. Using a maximum age of 54 the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.1, which is used as a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} in the assessment model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The 2005 STAR panel report compiled recommendations specific to vermilion, and also generic rockfish recommendations The generic rockfish recommendation are not presented here.

\textbf{Vermilion rockfish recommendations}

Investigation into the species composition of nominal vermilion rockfish is needed. It is not clear that separate assessments for the northern and southern areas are warranted for vermilion rockfish. Although there were differences in the estimated magnitude and timing of recruitment events, the estimated stock trends were similar in both areas. Pooling of data from northern and southern areas may permit a more robust assessment model to be obtained.

\emph{2021 STAT response} Since the 2005 assessment, vermilion rockfish were speciated to vermilion and sunset rockfishes {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Sunset rockfish are more common south of Pt. Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) and historical catches and length distributions between the two areas are different. The STAT discussed this at the Pre-Assessment workshop and all participants agreed that modeling the areas separately was an appropriate decision.

\textbf{General rockfish Recommendations}

-The historical catch is an important input into any stock assessment. Although efforts have been made to construct catch time series for California rockfish, a more sustained effort is needed to do this for all rockfish species. It should not be left to individual analysts to do this for a species as stock assessments arise. It should be done by a specialist team for all species simultaneously, so that consistent times series can beestablished.

-Management changes affect fisher behaviour and alter the correct interpretation of CPUE time series. As for catch histories, it is important that a specialist team consider and document all management changes and how they may have impacted on catch rates for all species. Again, this should not be left to individual assessment authors as the issues are generic and patterns might not be obvious without a multi-species perspective.

-Improved documentation of input data and output for GLM analyses of CPFV and RecFIN CPUE data is recommended. In general, GLM analyses should provide analysis of deviance tables, estimated coefficients, and their standard errors to document these calculations. Information on amount of RecFIN records filtered by species association also needs to be presented to show the effect of the species association analysis. Although this method is an objective approach to filtering records, it is unknown how well works in practice to reduce the potential biases of CPUE data. A paper describing a comprehensive application of GLM methods to CPFV and RecFIN CPUE data on California rockfish would be a important contribution to the assessment process and the primary literature.

-Many rockfish assessments use CPUE data from the CPFV fishery as an index of population abundance. The CPFV fishery is focused primarily on marketing a successful ``fishing experience'' that is related to the desirability of the species caught, quantity, body size, and fighting characteristics. The default assumption of proportionality between CPUE and abundance has not been evaluated for a fishery with these characteristics. Simulation modeling of fleet dynamics in a multi-species context is one possible way to address these issues.

-A more complete understanding of the multi-species aspects of rockfish population dynamics is needed. Although some rockfish stocks have declined in recent decades under heavy fishing pressure and environmental change, other rockfish species have apparently increased. Are these species adapted to different environmental conditions, or are these increases due to the indirect effects of reduced competition and/or predation?

Conducting additional assessments of the many relatively uncommon rockfish in California is a difficult but worthwhile objective. To facilitate this process, the Panel has a number suggestions:

\tagstructbegin{tag=L}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  Keep the models simple.\\

  \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  Make reasonable assumptions based on life history and better studied species for parameters that cannot be reliably estimated, such as natural mortality, stock-recruit steepness, selectivity.\\

  \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  Think meta-analytically. For example, similar species that are often caught together are likely to have experienced similar fishing mortality rates and trends. There are also more rigorous methods for sharing information between related stocks that could be considered.\\

  \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  Make the most of CPUE data:

    \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

    For several assessments, indices from GLM analyses of site-specific CPFV data apparently tracked population trends better than indices from RecFIN data, even when a subset of records had been selected using the Stevens and MacCall (2004) procedure. Greater priority should be given to collecting site-specific CPUE data. Given the ubiquity of GPS systems and hand-held data recorders, obstacles to collecting site-specific information from fisheries are now logistic rather than technological.\\

    \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend

    \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend

    \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

    \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

    Location information for the historical groundfish catch data of all species is currently available, in hard copy form only, from the California Department of Fish and Game. Putting this information into electronic format would greatly improve the ability to assign catches of all species to specific stocks on a trip-bytrip basis.\\

    \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend

    \tagmcend\tagstructend\tagstructend
  \end{itemize}

  \tagstructend
\item
  \tagstructbegin{tag=LI}\tagstructbegin{tag=LBody}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

  Do not put too much trust in model results. Models are no better that their input data and assumptions, and for many rockfish species, the data are sparse and potentially misleading.

Vermilion rockfish NCA of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) off the coast of California is assessed using a two-sex model with sex-specific life history parameters.\\
The model assumed seven fleets with removals beginning in 1875:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Commercial hook-and-line fishery
  \item Commercial trawl fishery
  \item Commercial net fishery
  \item Recreational PC retained fishery
  \item Recreational PC discard fishery
  \item Recreational PR retained fishery
  \item Recreational PR discard fishery
\end{enumerate}

Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for all fleets. The recreational PC and PR fleets applied three time blocks for selectivity: 1875 - 2001, 2002 - 2016, - 2017 - 2020. All commercial fleet selectivity was constant across model years 1875 - 2020,

The model has the additional survey fleets:

The prior is a beta distribution with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(mu\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.72 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.16.

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(h\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}; beta distribution with {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\mu\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.72 and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}=0.15) is retained.

\#\#\#Data Weighting Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for the base model were tuned by the ``Francis method,'' based on equation TA1.8 in Francis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing the residuals in the model's expected mean length with respect to the observed mean length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0.

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(McAllister, Murdoch K.; Ianelli 1997)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Additionally, weighting using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) that scales the input sample size, was explored. H

A series of sensitivities were conducted to determine the need to estimate extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the survey CPUE indices, and described below in the Estimated Parameters section.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Model convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(\textbf{Methot2019?})\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This was repeated 300 times and the minimum was reached in 67\% of the runs (Table \ref{tab:jitter}). The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001, when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability. We did sensitivity runs for convergence by changing the phases for key estimated parameters; neither the total log-likelihood nor the parameter estimates changed.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model, 2020. Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) was 140.88 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40\% of the unfished level ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 497.31 million eggs.

The predicted spawning output from the base model shows frogs (Figure \ref{fig:ssb}). The spawning output then frogs.

The 2020. spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished levels (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\((1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, was above the management target frogs (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}).

The state of California implements regional management for the recreational fleet in the form of five regions, referred to as management areas with differing depth and season restrictions. Until there is additional information on the distribution, life history differences between sunset and vermilion rockfishes, the current regional management framework is appropriate. The results from the ongoing SK grant exploring vermilion and sunset rockfish genetics will provide a more appropriate. HOwever, given the difficulty of differentiating the cryptic species pair without genetic identification, it is not feasible to separate landings of the two species.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the 
vermilion/sunset complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within 
a single species and also between the two species.  Little biological data for south of 
Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed 
to better under biological parameters. 
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Conduct life history studies
     \item Conduct research to identify the proportion of each species in population and in catches
    \end{enumerate}


\item Take a closer look at the Ralston historical catch reconstruction (\cite{Ralston2010}) and 
all other historical data sources.

\item Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including 
a hierarchical structure and random effects. The CCFRP survey is the only 
fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky 
reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available, 
and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored 
since 2007.

\item Continue to investigate the most appropriate model structure for the NWFSC HL survey index.
The NWFSC HL survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat 
in the Southern California Bight. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey index given its expansion into the CCA, also independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey.Increased spatiotemporal sampling around Pt. Conception would aid in identifing stock boundaries.

\item Utilize existing ROV survey data sources

 \begin{enumerate}
     \item SWFSC Submersible Survey of the Cowcod Conservation Areaa (\cite{Yok2007}). 
    This was a line-transect survey designed to estimate cowcod abundance in 2002 conducted from a submersible inside the \gls{cca}.  Originally, only cowcod were enumerated from the video footage.  Over the last few years, the SWFSC has re-analyzed the video footage to enumerate other rockfish species. 
     \item The SWFSC Fishery Resource Division (FRD) conducted a survey of potential cowcod habitat between Point Conception and the U.S. – Mexico border from October through December of 2012 (\cite{Stierhoff2013}).
     \item SWFSC staff are submitting proposals to conduct an additional submirsible survey in the southern California Bight
      \item CDFW ROV survey data
    \end{enumerate}


\item Collection of length and age data are recommended for both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries.  Very little age data are available from either fishery for 
vermilion and sunset rockfishes.

\item Investigate possible environmental drivers/co-variates for biological parameters, 
particularly for recruitment.

\item Resolve differences between CalCOM and PacFIN expanded length composition data sets.

\subsubsection{Califronia Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019}\label{califronia-onboard-observer-survey-1999-2019}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling program in 1999 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(M. H. Monk, Dick, and Pearson 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows the protocols established in Reilly et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1998)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.\\
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for vermilion. Cal Poly has modified protocols reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at the level of a fisher's bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either CDFW or Cal Poly in 2020.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical in that the same protocols are followed. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index selectivity is mirrored to the recreational fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead) fish. Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length from CDFW sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and indlucded in the length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model.

A number of filters are applied to these data. All of the Cal Poly data were QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the data from CDFW. Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data.

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution. Reefs were developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material (``Reef Delineation''). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts north of Pt. Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths (Figure \ref{fig:fig-depthfished-cpfvonboard}. The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger areas considered as a factor in the index.

We retained 4481 drifts for index standardization, with 1706 drifts encountering vermilion (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-cpfvonboard}).

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-cpfvonboard}, \ref{tab:tab-depth-cpfvonboard}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-cpfvonboard}.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-cpfvonboard}).

A Lognormal model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 122.41 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-cpfvonboard}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-cpfvonboard}), a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-cpfvonboard} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-cpfvonboard}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 62\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-cpfvonboard}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-cpfvonboard} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-cpfvonboard}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-cpfvonboard}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-cpfvonboard}).

\subsubsection{California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project Index}\label{california-collaborative-fisheries-research-project-index}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/}{CCFRP}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, is a fishery-independent hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs along the central California coast {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wendt and Starr 2009; Starr et al. 2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The CCFRP survey began in 2007 and was originally designed as a statewide program in collaboration with NMFS scientists and fishermen. From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored four MPAs consistently. In 2017, the program was expanded coastwide within California. The index of abundance was developed from the four MPAs sampled consistently (Año Nuevo and Point Lobos by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists a number 500 x 500 m cells both within and outside each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells). CPFVs are chartered for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for a fishing location. During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured, and can be linked back to a particular angler, and released (or descended to depth). Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin clips that provide needed biological information for nearshore species. For the index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.

\emph{CCFRP Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little filtering was needed for the index. Cells not consistently sampled over time were excluded as well as cells that never encountered vermilion. CCFRP samples shallower depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality. We retained 6532 drifts for index standardization, with 2250 drifts encountering vermilion.

\emph{CCFRP Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-ccfrp} and \ref{tab:tab-year-ccfrp}. We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-ccfrp}). Plots of the arithmetic mean by inside (MPA) and outside (REF) MPAs over time is in Figure \ref{fig:fig-sitecpue-ccfrp}.

A Lognormal model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 362.81 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-ccfrp}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-ccfrp}), a main effects model including YEAR and SITE and DEPTH bin was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and SITE and DEPTH bin was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-ccfrp} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-ccfrp}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 66\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-ccfrp}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-ccfrp} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-ccfrp}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-ccfrp}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-ccfrp}).

\subsubsection{CRFS Dockside Private Boat Index}\label{crfs-dockside-private-boat-index}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2018, were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e.~effort units are angler trips), angler-reported distance from shore, (Area.X: inside/outside of 3 nm, county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The sample size of the unfiltered private boat CPUE data is much larger than the crfspr CPFV data set, with 391,279 trips statewide, 120,655 in southern California (south of Point Conception), and 270,064 north of Point Conception.

\emph{CRFS Private Boat Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes} Records were limited to ``PR1'' sites, and only the hook-and-line gear type (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr}. Since this is a dockside index lacking precise fishing location information, we use the percent of groundfish within the catch from a trip as a proxy for retaining trips for index standardization. Similar to the crfspr index, we partitioned the data into areas north and south of Point Conception and applied the method separately to each data set.

Since 2005, the recreational fishery for shelf rockfish north of Pt. Conception has been closed from January through part of April and May.Angler reported distance from shore had no samples in the ``outside 3 nm'' category (Area X = 2) from 2004-2011, but was retained in the index standardization due to the relaxation of depth restrictions beginning in 2017. We retained 59837 drifts for index standardization, with 21971 drifts encountering vermilion (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr}).

\emph{Northern California CRFS Private Boat Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-crfspr} and \ref{tab:tab-year-crfspr}. We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-crfspr}).

A Lognormal model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 3718.2 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-crfspr}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-crfspr}), a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and AREA X was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and AREA X was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-crfspr} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-crfspr}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 63\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-crfspr}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-crfspr} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-crfspr}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-crfspr}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-crfspr}).

\subsubsection{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index}\label{deb-wilson-vandenberg-index}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted by CDFW survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Reilly et al. 1998)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop. The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.

\textbf{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Melissa H. Monk et al. 2016)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop were recorded at a finer scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch information. Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the vessel is available. We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore excluded from the analysis (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-debwv}). Sampling targeted areas of central California. Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of those launched from port in District 6, which was removed from the analysis.

Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps and interpretation of hard bottom was extracted from the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes; Ft. Bragg to Santa Cruz (V1), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V2), San Luis Obispo to Pt. Conception (V3), and Offshore (deeper) locations including the Farallon Islands and reefs of Half Moon Bay and Monterey Bay (V4). The ports in San Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and the arithmetic mean of CPUE by year was higher also higher in this area (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-debwv})

We retained 6597 drifts for index standardization, with 2016 fishing location encountering vermilion.\\
Tables of the number of samples and positive observervations by factor can be found in Tables (\ref{tab:tab-depth-debwv}, \ref{tab:tab-region-debwv}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-debwv}).

\textbf{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

A Lognormal model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 313.12 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-debwv}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-debwv}), a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-debwv} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-debwv}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 69\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-debwv}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-debwv} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-debwv}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-debwv}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-debwv}).

\subsubsection{MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index, 1980-1999}\label{mrfss-dockside-cpfv-index-1980-1999}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of recreational CPFV fishing fleet. No MRFSS CPUE data are available for the years 1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. Sampling of California CPFVs north of Point Conception was further delayed, and CPFV samples n 1993 and 1994 are limited to San Luis Obispo County. For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series was truncated at 1999 due to sampling overlap with the onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for the same vessel).

Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers being interviewed. The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials (``Identifying Trips in RecFIN'').

\textbf{MRFSS CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

Trips recorded as having the primary area fished in Mexico or occurring in bays, e.g., San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition. For indices representing only north of Pt. Conception, the years 1993-1994 were excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2004)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} filtering approach was used to predict the probability of of catching vermilion, based on the species composition of the sampler observed catch in a given trip. Prior to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model. The remaining 25 all co-occurred with vermilion in at least one trip and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for species that are more likely to co-occur with vermilion, and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with vermilion (Figure \ref{fig:fig-sm-mrfss}). The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with vermilion include Gopher, Flag, Copper, Canary, and Starry rockfishes, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were Chinook salmon, Widow and Greenspotted rockfishes, Chub mackerel and Rosy rockfish.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one species or species complex (``mixed trips'') can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2004)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} recommended including all trips above a threshold where the false negatives and false positives are equally balanced. However, this does not have any biological relevance and for this data set, we assume that if a vermilion was landed, the anglers had to have fished in appropriate habitat, especially given vermilion is strongly associated with rocky habitat.

The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence at which the rate of ``false positives'' equals ``false negatives'' of 0.35. The trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method including all the ``false positive'' trips, regardless of the probability of encountering vermilion. This assumes that if vermilion were caught, the anglers must have fished in appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is ``sampler-examined'' and the samplers are well trained in species identification.

Stephens and MacCall proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch a vermilion based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a vermilion, given the catch composition, but caught at least one. The threshold probability that balances FP and FN excludes 1182 trips that did not catch a vermilion (52\% of the trips), and 188 trips (8\% of the data) that caught a vermilion. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that catching a vermilion indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing effort occurred in habitat where vermilion occur. Only ``true negatives'' (the 1182 trips that neither caught vermilion, nor were predicted to catch them by the model) were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included 1083 trips, 70\% of which encountered vermilion. Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables \ref{tab:tab-region-mrfss} and \ref{tab:tab-year-mrfss}.

\textbf{MRFSS CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be ill-fitting and the proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore \textless3 nm, offshore \textgreater3 nm) factors were evaluated. Two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte to Santa Cruz (``N'') and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo (``C'') north of Pt. Conception. For models that span counties north and south of Pt. Conception, Santa Barbara to San Diego counties compose a third region (``S''). For models tha exclusively south of Pt. Conception, the region represent individual counties. Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss}).

A Lognormal model was selected for the positive observation GLM by a {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\Delta AIC\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} of 62.35 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss}). The delta-GLM method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-mrfss}), a main effects model including YEAR and SubRegion was fit for the binomial model and a main effects model including NA was fit for the Lognormal model. Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-mrfss} and \ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-mrfss}). The binomial model generated data sets with the proportion zeros similar to the 30\% zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-mrfss}). The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-mrfss} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-mrfss}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-mrfss}) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-mrfss}).
