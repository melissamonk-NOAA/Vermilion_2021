\subsection{Basic Information and Life History}\label{basic-information-and-life-history}}

\emph{Note: Prior to the identification of sunset rockfish as a separate species (n.d.), historical studies of ``vermilion'' rockfish, particularly those conducted south of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$), California, could have included a mixture of both species. Also, many current studies and data sets (e.g., landing statistics) do not distinguish between the species. In this document, we refer simply to ``vermilion rockfish'' when no species-specific information is available.}

Vermilion rockfish (\emph{Sebastes miniatus}) range from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to central Baja California at
depths of 6 m to 436 m (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). However, they are most commonly found from central Oregon
to Punta Baja, Mexico (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009) at depths of 50 m to 150 m (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009). Hyde and Vetter
(2009) describe vermilion rockfish as residents of shallower depths (\textless100 m) than their sibling species,
sunset rockfish (\emph{Sebastes crocotulus}). Adult fish tend to cluster on high relief rocky outcrops (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)
and kelp forests (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009). North of Point Conception, California, some adults are shallower,
living in caves and cracks (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). Vermilion rockfish have shown high site fidelity
(Hannah and Rankin 2011 (only tagged 1 vermilion); Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999), and low to average larval dispersal
distance (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009). Lowe et al.~(2009) (2009) suggested that vermilion rockfish
have a lower site fidelity than previously believed, but acknowledged that their
observations of movements to different depths may have been due to differences in depth distribution between the species.
Vermilion rockfish have been aged to over 80 years, but few fish have been aged above 60 years, with females growing larger than their male counterparts. 50\% of females are mature at 5 years and about
37 cm, with males probably maturing at shorter lengths than females (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002).

Vermilion rockfish are viviparous, and females produce an estimated 63,000 to 2,600,000 eggs per brood, with larger fish releasing a substantially larger number of larvae.
In southern California, vermilion rockfish larvae are released between July and March.
In central and northern California, this release occurs in September, December, and
April-June (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). Larval release in fall and winter is not common among other
rockfish species. Hyde and Vetter (2009) suggest that low larval dispersal may
be due to weak poleward flow of nearshore waters corresponding with peak vermilion larval release.

Young-of-the-year vermilion rockfish settle out of the water column during two primary recruitment
periods per year, first from February to April and a second from August to October,
and settlement has been observed in May off southern California (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). Larvae
measure about 4.3 mm. Young-of-the-year vermilion and sunset rockfish are both mottled
brown with areas of black, and older juveniles turn a mottled orange or red color (Milton S. Love et al. 2012).
Juvenile fish are found individually from 6 m to 36 m, living near sand and structures.
After two months, juveniles travel deeper and live on low relief rocky outcrops and
other structures (M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002).

Adult vermilion rockfish predominantly eat smaller fish, though sometimes they pursue
euphausiids and other various macroplankton (Phillips 1964). Love (2002) noted
their diet includes octopuses, salps, shrimps, and pelagic red crabs.

\emph{Population Structure and Multi-species Assessment Considerations}

This assessment represents the aggregate population dynamics of the cryptic species pair vermilion rockfish
and sunset rockfish.
Hyde (2007) examinedseven mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, which upon analysis suggested
three species within the subgenus \emph{Rosicola}. Hyde et al.~
(n.d.) described sunset rockfish as a distinct species noting depth separation
of the adult populations of the two species using nine microsatellite loci.
Adult sunset rockfish are mainly distributed at depths
greater than 50 fm (100 m) and are predominantly located south of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$).
Hyde (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009) and Budrick (Budrick 2016) identified speciation using mtDNA assays and microsatellite loci,
respectively. The mtDNA analyses proved to be subject to errors in species identification due to introgression resulting from mating between the two species post-divergence.
Additional population clusters of vermilion were found north of Point Conception, but neither
study detected population structure between Half Moon Bay, California and Brookings,
Oregon (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009; Budrick 2016).

Vermilion and sunset rockfishes are morphologically very similar, with color being
the most commonly
cited differentiating feature. Hyde (2009) noted differences in three of six morphological
parameters examined, but none of them can readily be used for field identification.

In all historical and current recreational and commercial catches, sunset and
vermilion rockfish are both recorded as vermilion rockfish. Future studies,
such as the one described below will provide data needed to compare biological
parameters between the two species as well as habitats.

\emph{Ongoing Population Structure Research (Provided by John Harms, NWFSC)}

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to
genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic
pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the Southern
CA Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019. Funding for this
project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for FY 2020 through a
proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and
the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along
the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed. Some
earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) markers. However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from
the vermilion genome into the sunset genome, a portion of the sunset rockfish
population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish
resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals
during the prior research project. The current research has identified a robust
suite of genetic markers within the nuclear genomes of the two species that
definitively separates vermilion and sunset rockfish (including introgressed
sunset rockfish), canary rockfish, first generation vermilion-sunset hybrids,
and identifies emerging patterns of intraspecific stock structure within the
two sister species.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences
in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships,
and other biological characteristics will be identified. Using previously
collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including
age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at
50\% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared.
These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA
work to evaluate whether introgressed sunset rockfish represent a biologically
intermediate subform of the species complex. The effort also proposes to develop
and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two
species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of
co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other
information. The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens
is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock
assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair
and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community. If
successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors,
may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and
management of cryptic species complexes. Though this project will only focus
on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey
field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard
fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs
continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely
monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.

\hypertarget{ecosystem-considerations}{%
\subsection{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations}}

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions,
habitat factors (other than as they inform relative abundance indices) or environmental
factors into the assessment model, but a brief description of likely or potential
ecosystem considerations are provided below.

Vermilion/sunset rockfish are described as feeding on a wide range of both
pelagic and benthic prey items, including forage fish species such as anchovies
and mesopelagic fishes, squid, krill and octopus, as well as sporadically abundant
pelagic organisms such as pyrosomes, salps and pelagic red crabs
(Phillips 1964; M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). Interestingly, other rockfishes (either juvenile or
adult stages) have not been
documented as prey for vermilion, as they have been for other large \emph{Sebastes}
species such as cowcod, bocaccio, and yelloweye rockfish. For the latter species,
the idea of ``cultivation effects,'' in which adults crop down forage species that
are potential competitors/predators of their own juveniles (Walters and Kitchell 2001),
has been suggested by Baskett, Yoklavich, and Love (2006). For example, Baskett et al. (2006)
found that in such scenarios there could be alternative stable states in which
either the overfished species or the smaller prey species could dominate. While
the sparse diet data for vermilion/sunset rockfish do not suggest such a process
for this species complex, food habits data for vermilion/sunset are not robust,
and the larger community processes on these rocky reef communities may also influence
productivity and community composition regardless of the direct predation interactions.
Pelagic and benthic juvenile vermilion and sunset rockfish are likely preyed upon by
the same wide range of predators that prey on juveniles and adults of other rockfish
species, including seabirds, piscivorous fishes, and marine mammals.

As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment,
or cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for the vermilion/sunset
rockfish complex, with only a modest apparent relationship to estimated levels of spawning output.\\
Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of
recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements
of California Current food webs. Empirical estimates of recruitment from pelagic
juvenile rockfish surveys have been used to inform incoming year class strength for
some of these stocks, however vermilion and sunset rockfish are rarely encountered
in these surveys. Specifically, only 47 of nearly 300,000 total juvenile \emph{Sebastes}
encountered in juvenile surveys since 2001 were identified as vermilion or sunset
rockfish (Field et al. 2021). Despite this, the results here suggest that at least a
reasonable fraction of recruitment variability for sunset and vermilion rockfish
is shared with other rockfish and groundfish stocks throughout the California Current,
many of which also had strong year classes in 1984, 1999 and 2015-2016. Previous studies
have demonstrated that large-scale oceanographic drivers, such as the relative transport
of subarctic waters (typically indicated by relative sea level) tend to relate to a
substantial fraction of overall groundfish recruitment trends and ecosystem
productivity Schroeder et al. (2019). Although it is feasible that
ecosystem factors, the results of pre-recruit surveys for co-occurring species,
or the results of other groundfish assessments might ultimately be used to
forecast recruitment for more data-limited stocks such as vermilion/sunset,
as suggested by (Thorson and Ward 2014), such approaches would require more
development and evaluation. Consequently, environmental factors are not
explicitly considered in this assessment.

\hypertarget{historical-and-current-fishery-information}{%
\subsection{Historical and Current Fishery Information}\label{historical-and-current-fishery-information}}

\emph{Commercial Fishery}
The commercial groundfish fishery off California developed in the late 19th century and consisted mainly of hook and line gear types. At the turn of the century, total rockfish landings were estimated to be on the range of 2000 to 3500 tons statewide, with slightly over half of the catch during this period coming from waters south of Point Conception, and most of the remaining catch from central California ports (particularly San Francisco and Monterey). Catches declined through the 1930s as a result of the rapid expansion of the California sardine fishery, which tended to be more profitable.
(M. Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). The rockfish trawl fishery rapidly expanded into California in the early 1940s, after the introduction of the `balloon trawl,' and whenthe United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red
meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein (Alverson, Pruter, and Ronholt 1964; Harry and Morgan 1961; \textbf{Lenarz1987?}). Trawl landings have been restricted in most of southern California for decades (\textbf{Frey1971?}), and trawl gear north of Point Conception has not been a major component of the landings for vermilion, with the highest reported landings in the 1970s. The commercial setnet fishery has never been a large component of the vermilion rockfish landings and has essentially been non-existent for vermilion since 2002 when the state of California prohibited set net gear in 60 fm or less. The largest net landings for vermilion were in the 1980s.

Vermilion have been landed in the commercial live-fish fishery that developed off the coast of
California in the 1990s, but have not been a major target of that fishery due to their susceptibility to barotrauma.\\
The fraction of the total catch
from the live fish fleet is small, concentrated in northern California, and included in the commercial hook-and-line
fleet in the northern California assessment models. The STAT also learned that vermilion
targeted for the live fish fishery, but landed
dead due to barotrauma, are still sold. Separation of catch and size compositions for the live and dead catch is therefore less informative and was not pursued further.

Miller et al. (2014) described the spatial and temporal development of the
California groundfish fishery based on historical CDFW fish ticket and block summary data. They analyzed a spatially-explicit database of
landings in California dating back to 1933, finding that groundfish fishing effort
has shifted from shallow, coastal areas to deeper depths, greater distances from
Port, and in areas of more inclement weather over time. That general result was also found with limited data from recreational fisheries. Sampling of commercial species compositions in Southern California
began in 1983, a time when the groundfish fleet was already fishing in deeper depths.
Both historical reconstructions used these data to represent species compositions of
total rockfish catch during earlier periods of the fishery. aAs a result, the reconstructions may
overestimate the percentage of deep-water speciesin earlier fisheries that operated closer
to port and in shallower depths.
\emph{Recreational Fishery}
The Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV; aka `party' and `charter' boat)
fleet began ca. 1919 in California, although recreational fishing effort for
fishes other than Tunas, other gamefish, and salmon was minimal until about 1930. The CPFV fleet numbered about 200 vessels in 1939 {[}Croker (1940), cited in Young (1969)).
After a hiatus in most operations during WWII, the fleet increased to about 590 vessels
by 1953, then declined to approximately 256 vessels around 1963.

Vermilion rockfish are a targeted species in California's recreational fishery
and have always ranked high in terms of catch among rockfish species, both in the party/charter
boat and private/rental sectors. Onboard surveys of CPFV vessels in southern California ranked vermilion as the 5th and 3rd most common rockfish species in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, respectively (\textbf{CollinsCrookeUnpublished?}; \textbf{Ally1991?}). Onboard CPFV observers in central California saw vermilion rockfish in over 27\% of all observed drifts over the period 1987-1998, making vermilion rockfish 5th among rockfish species in terms of encounter rates per drift (Melissa H. Monk et al. 2016)

In southern California, harvest of vermilion from recreational fisheries, as a percentage of the total vermilion harvest, varied considerably from 1980 to 2000. After 2000, largely due to reduced commercial access to shelf habitat, recreational fisheries accounted for almost all the vermilion harvest in Southern California, with relatively minor contributions from the commercial fleets. Similar patterns occurred north of Point Conception, with the majority of vermilion rockfish landings coming to ports in San Luis Obispo county.

\hypertarget{summary-of-management-history}{%
\subsection{Summary of Management History}\label{summary-of-management-history}}

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
in 1982, vermilion rockfish were managed through a regulatory process that included the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) along
with either the California State Legislature or the Fish and Game Commission (FGC)
depending on the sector (recreation or commercial) and fishery. With implementation
of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, vermilion rockfish came under the management
authority of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), and were managed as part
of the \emph{Sebastes} complex. Because neither species had undergone rigorous stock assessment
and did not compose a large fraction of the landings they were classified and
managed as part of ``Remaining Rockfish'' under the larger
heading of ``Other Rockfish'' (PFMC (2004, 2002)).

Since the early 1980s a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to
manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally
for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish
fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access
with specific regulations designed for each component. Other regulatory actions
for the general rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions,
and cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial sectors -
limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl.
Harvest guidelines are also used to regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and
commercial sectors.

In 2000, changes in the PFMC's rockfish management structure resulted in the discontinued
use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and was replaced with three species
groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes (January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221), of
which vermilion rockfish are included in the minor shelf rockfish group.

Since the enactment of California's Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), the Council and State in a coordinated
effort developed and adopted various management specifications to keep harvest
within the harvest targets, including seasonal and area closures (e.g.~the CCAs;
a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, minimum
size limits, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license
and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal
and area closures (e.g.~the RCAs and CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to
specific fishing), depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size
limits to regulate the commercial fishery (Wilson-Vandenberg, Larinto, and Key 2014).

\textbf{Management of Recreational Fisheries}

In March 1984 California adopted a general 20 aggregate daily bag limit that included a sub-bag limit of 10 fish for any given species. Significant regulatory changes in California's
recreational sector began with a change
from unlimited number of hooks and lines allowed prior to 2000 to no more than
three hooks and one line per angler in 2000. Since 2001, the limit has been no more than
two hooks and one line per angler. Beginning January 1, 2021 there is a five-fish sub-bag limit for vermilion rockfish. There is no size limit in the recreational fishery
for vermilion rockfish.

California also began spatial management, including area closures, and depth
restrictions for the recreational fleet in 2000. In general, the recreational
season north of Point Conception
extends from April to December, and south of Point Conception from March to December.
In the area that vermilion rockfish are most commonly landed, from Monterey to Morro Bay, the
maximum depth open to recreational fishing has been between 30 and 40
fathoms until 2017. In 2017 the depth restrictions were eased by 10 fathoms,
opening up fishing depths along the central California coast that had not been
open consistently since 2002. In
both 2017 and 2018, the deepest 10 fathoms was closed prior to the prescribed
season in December due to high by-catch rates of yelloweye rockfish, which is still
overfished. A full history of the recreational
regulations relating to the spatial management of the fleet can be found frog.

\textbf{Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCA)}
In 2001, two area closures \href{https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36132\&inline}{``Cowcod Conservation Areas''} were implemented to reduce fishing mortality of cowcod, originally prohibiting bottom-fishing deeper than 20 fm. Effective 2019, retention of nearshore and shelf rockfish (excluding cowcod) is allowed in depths shallower than 40 fm. The larger of the two areas (CCA West) is a 4200 square mile area west of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. A smaller area (CCA East) is about 40 miles offshore of San Diego, and covers about 100 square miles.

\textbf{Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCA)}
In 2002 the PFMC established trawl- and non-trawl area closures known as the Rockfish Conservation Areas. These closed areas are gear-specific, and have seasonally changing boundaries to help reduce fishing mortality.

\subsection{Management Performance}\label{management-performance-1}}

The contribution of vermilion rockfish to the shelf rockfish OFLs is currently derived from
the data-poor Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis(E. J. Dick and MacCall 1994). A 2005
assessment was not accepted for management and a 2013 data-moderate assessment
was not reviewed by the STAR panel due to insufficient time.

Total mortality for vermilion rockfish was obtained from the Groundfish Expanded Mortality
Multiyear \href{https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/api/v1/source/observer.gemm_fact/selection.xlsx}{GEMM}
report (Somers et al. 2020). The coastwide management of the shelf rockfish complex is split at Cape
Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$). Therefore, the northern California vermilion rockfish
model contains a portion of the management area from Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime N$)
to the California-Oregon border ($42^\circ 00^\prime N$). The southern California vermilion rockfish contains the
area within the southern management area (south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$) south of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$).

The total mortality of the shelf rockfish
south complex has been above the OFL in all years (2011-2019) north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$, and
above the OFL south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ from 2015-2019. Total mortality
estimates from the NMFS NWFSC are not yet available for 2020 (Table \ref{tab:management}. Vermilion rockfish total
mortality was on average 59\% (range 55\%-66\%) of the total shelf rockfish south
of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ total mortality from 2011-2016. Vermilion rockfish decreased from 21\% to 4\% of
the total contribution to the shelf rockfish complex north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$ from 2011-2019 with a
noticeable decline from 16\% to 6\% from 2016 to 2017.

The STAT presented proposed analyses and data sources for the 2021 vermilion rockfish
assessment during the PFMC Pre-Assessment Workshop for 2021 Vermilion and
Lingcod Stock Assessments, hosted virtually on March 29, 2021. Topics addressed
included progress on research priorities, data sources and types, stock structure,
fleet structure, key model parameters (e.g.~natural mortality), and potential
challenges. Descriptions of each data source included in the model
(Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}) and sources that were explored, but not included

\subsection{Fishery-Dependent Data}\label{fishery-dependent-data}}

A complete summary of estimated vermilion rockfish removals by each fleet in the
commercial and recreational fleets modeled in this assessment is provided in Table
\ref{tab:landings}. The data sources for landings varied by each fleet and a summary
of each data source and the time period for which it was used is in Table \ref{tab:catch-source}.
Of note is that the commercial landings are in metric tons (mt) and the recreational landings
are in numbers of fish (thousands of fish). Data and
methods used to derive these estimates are described in this section.

\hypertarget{commercial-landings-and-discards}{%
\subsubsection{Commercial Landings and Discards}\label{commercial-landings-and-discards}}

\emph{Commercial Landings Prior to 1916}

For landings estimates prior to 1916, we based our reconstruction on the total
rockfish catches reported in a summary of early California fisheries landings by
Sette and Fielder (1927) for the years 1888, 1892, 1895, 1899, 1904, 1908
and 1915. No rockfish were reported for 1888. We assumed no catches prior to 1875
and interpolated the catches between 0 and the 1892 catches (total of 834
tons) reported. Similarly, catches between the reported years were interpolated
assuming a straight linear trend between the years reported. We used a
ratio-estimator derived from the catch reconstruction fraction of vermilion
rockfish in total rockfish landings for the 1916 to 1919 period (the ratio for
a comparable five year period was nearly identical). We apportioned the catches
north and south of Point Conception based on ratio estimators that used the same
assumptions used to apportion catches in the reconstruction time period (1916-1968).
The catch reconstruction estimates indicated that vermilion made up slightly under
1\% of the total rockfish catches during the early (1916-1919) time period, although
the estimates indicate a slightly larger fraction (1.5\%) of total catches south of
Conception relative to the fraction of total catches to the north (0.9\%). However,
it is likely that the reconstruction is overestimating the fraction of smaller and/or
more deeply distributed species relative to larger, shallower species as the
reconstruction is based on the species composition data collected from market
category samples in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The fishery has been shown
to have progressed over time from a shallower, more nearshore distribution of
effort to one in which deeper and more offshore waters were targeted (Miller et al. 2014).
The notion that vermilion catches may have been greater is also consistent with
the recognition by Roedel (1948) that during the 1930s and 1940s vermilion
were ``One of the more important commercial species, it is one of three leading
species in Southern California.'' However, by the time of that report, vermilion
represented five to eight percent of the southern California catch (based on
Ralston et al. (2010)), much more than at the beginning of the time
series. This uncertainty is investigated more deeply in the model uncertainty and sensitivity section. Future efforts to improve historical catch reconstructions by accounting
for the shift in effort over time to deeper waters should continue to be flagged
as a research need.

\emph{Commercial Landings, 1916-2020}

For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction
database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction (Stephen Ralston et al. 2010).
Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl,' and `unknown' gear
categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. (2010) were
assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al.~includes Santa
Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports in San
Luis Obispo County (north of Point Conception). To allocate catches from Region
6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used
by Dick et al. (2007) for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically,
port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were
used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of
Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-allocate}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported
at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition
catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the
absence of port-specific species composition data.

Years with no data were imputed
using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations
(Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from
known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were
allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way,
total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by
Ralston et al. (2010), and assigned to the assessment areas north and
south of Point Conception, and either trawl or `non-trawl' gear types.Since hook and line gears catch the majority of
commercially-caught vermilion rockfish, we assigned estimated catch in the
`non-trawl' category to the hook and line fleet in the assessment model.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS)
incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into
the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''),
including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish
landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition
samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These
`ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the
CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available
landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes. Since commercial
port sampling south of Point Conception started later, ratio estimates were used
in some southern California port complexes through 1983. See Appendix A of Dick
et al. (2007) and Pearson et al. (2008); pp.~8 and 15-16{]} for
further details.

Commercial catches from 1978-present were pulled from the CALCOM database, which is stratified using an identical design as the pre-1978 data described above and ensured consistency of the port complex and gear groupings over the entire time series (1969-2020). Although available strata definitions within PacFIN do not match the design of the California commercial catch expansion (\textbf{Pearson19xx?}), the STAT was able to manually aggregate data from PacFIN to almost exactly match the CALCOM estimates (Figure \ref(fig:calcom-pacfin)). The STAT recommends that port complex and gear group definitions used to expand California commercial catch estimates be incorporated into PacFIN lookup tables to facilitate future comparisons, ensure consistency between the two systems, and help identify potential errors.

\emph{Commercial length and age composition data}

Biological data (lengths) from the commercial fisheries that landed vermilion rockfish were extracted
from CALCOM. The CALCOM length composition data were ``expanded'' (catch-weighted by stratum, then aggregated by region, gear group, and year) to better represent the size composition of the landed catch.
. The length composition and mean
lengthby year are available in Figures \ref{fig:len-data-COM-HKL} and \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data-COM-HKL}
for the commercial hook-and-line fleet,
\ref{fig:len-data-COM-TWL} and \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data-COM-TWL} for the commercial trawl fleet,
and @ref(fig:len-data-COM-NET and \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data-COM-NET} for the commercial net fleet.
Input sample sizes for commercial length composition were based on the number of port samples and are in Table \ref{tab:length-sample-size}. Length compositions with fewer than 30 measured fish in a region/gear/year combination were not included in the model likelihood.

Commercial discard length compositions from WCGOP were provided on
17 Nov 2020 by Andi Stephens (NWFSC). Only 224 vermilion were measured statewide from
2004-2018. The sparse discard length composition data were not considered for use in the
model as discarded catch is a small fraction of the overall commercial landings.

Otoliths collected from commercial fisheries north of Point Conception were provided by
the Pacific States Fisheries Commission and aged, but not used in the assessment due
to low annual sample sizes.

\emph{Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003}

MRFSS estimates of California recreational landings from 1980-1989 and 1993-2003\\
were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network
(\href{https://www.recfin.org/}{RecFIN}). The MRFSS survey design included stratification by
species (sunset rockfish were not recognized at the time), subregion (northern
and southern California), 2-month `wave,' water area (e.g.~within or beyond
three miles from shore), and fishing mode (party/charter (PC) and private/rental (PR) boats,
plus various shore modes). The PC mode includes the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel
fleet (CPFV).

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) missing or imprecise estimates of catch
in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, 2) a change in the
spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, and 3) a hiatus in
sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode
north of Point Conception. The STAT attempted to address each of these issues,
as described below. CRFS estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS
analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are
included with the MRFSS catch estimate tables.

The MRFSS estimated catch in numbers of fish and converted these to catch in
weight using estimates of average fish weight {[}kg{]} from the same stratum. When
a stratum contained an estimate of catch in numbers but was missing an average
weight, the estimate of catch in weight for that stratum was omitted (or sometimes
assigned a zero value) in the database. To correct these errors, the STAT first
identified strata with positive catch in numbers but missing or zero values for
catch in weight. Catch in weight for these strata was then estimated by imputing
a value of average weight based on the mean of the reported average weights in
the same year and subregion, which had a greater influence on average
weight than boat mode (Figure @(fig:rec-avg-weight)). The effect of this data imputation was relatively
minor for vermilion rockfish overall (\textasciitilde1\% increase in total catch by weight,
1980-2004). However, 70\% of missing catch in weight occurred over the years
2001-2004, with differences in individual year/mode/subregion combinations sometimes exceeding 10-20\%.

MRFSS catch estimates for California were spatially stratified into two subregions,
``Southern California'' (subregion 1) and ``Northern California'' (subregion 2).
During the 1990-1992 statewide hiatus in sampling, the definitions of these two
subregions changed. Specifically, San Luis Obispo (SLO) County was included in
the southern region prior to the hiatus (i.e.~1980-1989) (Witzig et al. 1992; Karpov, Albin, and Van Buskirk 1995),
but moved to the northern subregion starting in 1993. In order to create a
definition of spatial strata that is consistent and comparable over time, and
one that is consistently divided near Point Conception, the STAT examined
estimates of catch in numbers from a separate study (Albin and Karpov 1993) that used a finer spatial
resolution in the northern subregion (including SLO County). Over the period
1981-1986, numbers of vermilion rockfish landed in SLO County was found to
be roughly equal to the numbers of vermilion rockfish landed in all California
counties north of SLO County (Table @(tab:rec\_allocate)). Therefore, to approximate catches north
and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the `southern'
subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by an amount
equal to the northern subregion catch during the same period, and doubled the
northern subregion catch. On average, this `moves' the estimated SLO County
catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating
a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series.

Ultimately, the STAT chose to use recreational catch in numbers rather than catch in weight for the California assessment models. Since data from (Albin and Karpov 1993) were only available as catch in numbers, the ratios used to partition SLO County catch may not be consistent if applied to catch in weight due to differences in average weight between regions (Figure \ref{fig:rec-avg-weight}). Also, because missing weight estimates were concentrated over the period 2001-2004 rather than being spread over the entire time series, the method used to impute weights could have a greater influence on short-term stock dynamics.

As noted above, MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues.
The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the PC boat
mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County. To
produce catch estimates for the missing subregion/mode/year combinations, we
used linear interpolation. Shore modes were a minor component of the vermilion
catch and therefore combined with catches from the private (PR) boat mode into
a single fleet. Specifically, catches were aggregated by subregion (adjusted as
described above), year, and mode, and endpoints for the interpolations were
defined as 2-year averages to reduce the effects of interannual variability
in catch on interpolated estimates.

The MRFSS did not collect data on the size composition of discarded fish, although recent CRFS sampling shows that the mean size of discarded fish is smaller than retained catch. Since catch type ``B1'' is an angler-reported mixture of dead discards and landed fish which were unavailable to the sampler, the true size composition of B1 fish is unknown. To determine the effect of alternative assumptions about the size composition of discarded fish, the STAT separated B1 fish into a separate fleet in the model. This allowed us to apply size composition data from the more recent CRFS survey, and compare the result to a model that assumes B1 catch has the same size composition as the examined catch. Results are described in the model sensitivity section. Since the ratio of B1 catch to total catch (A+B1) was highly variable among years, an average B1/(A+B1) ratio was estimated for each subregion and boat mode. These average discard ratios were applied to the annual estimates of total catch to estimate annual discarded catch.

MRFSS estimates of catch and discard (1000s of fish) after adjustment for
changes in subregion definition and sampling gaps are shown in Table \ref{tab:landings}.

\emph{California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2020}

Estimates of recreational landings and discard since 2004 have been produced by
the CRFS. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, employing higher
sampling rates and producing estimates with finer spatial and temporal resolution. The CRFS also employs onboard CPFV observers, providing spatially referenced, drift-level estimates of catch and discard for a subset of anglers on observed groundfish trips, as well as length composition data for discarded catch. These data are extremely valuable to stock assessment (see the CRFS Onboard Index of Abundance Index for
further details).

CRFS mortality estimates for the period 2005-2020 were queried from {[}RecFIN{]} (www.recfin.org).
Reported estimates were aggregated into subregion (north and south of Point Conception) and boat mode (PC and PR), and filtered to exclude fish
caught in Mexican waters. Shore modes were a minor component of the recreational catch and were combined with the PR mode.

\emph{Discard mortality rates}\\
Total recreational mortality estimates provided to RecFIN are
adjusted using species- and depth-specific discard mortality rates.
The discard mortality rates for vermilion that were endorsed by the
SSC and adopted by the
PFMC in March 2017 are 20\% for 0-10 fm, 34\% for 10-20 fm, 50\% for 20-30 fm, and
100\% for greater than 30 fm.

Similar to the MRFSS data, CRFS discard estimates were treated as a separate fleet to evaluate the effect of alternative size composition assumptions on model results. However, estimates of retained and released dead fish (in numbers) by subregion and mode are available from the RecFIN website, and these were used in the model. Other than combining PR and shore modes, the estimates described above were used without modification.

\emph{Recreational length composition data}

Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

There are no available recreational length composition data available for 2020 north
of Point Conception in RecFIN and sparse sampling was confirmed by J. Budrick (CDFW, pers. comm,).
Data collected during the Miller and Gotshall study was also used by Karpov (1995) to compare MRFSS and historical estimates. Some sections of the assessment refer to the Miller and Gotshall dataset as ``Karpov'' data.

\emph{Recreational age composition data}

There are no recreational age composition data available for vermilion rockfish from state sampling
programs.
Otoliths are available from collaborative with Cal Poly to investigate

These otoliths were not aged for this assessment.

\emph{Recreational indices of abundance}

A number of indices of abundance were explored for the recreational fleet. There were no or limited recreational index data from 2020 due to COVID-19. Discard catch is available from onboard observer surveys, but was not included in indices. The STAT considered developing separate indices for discards, but sample sizes were not large enough to warrant modeling. The CDFW CPFV logbook data were not considered as an index of abundance due to the fact that
vermilion may not be reported to the species level.

\subsubsection{NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey}\label{nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}}

The West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS) is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m (Keller, Wallace, and Methot 2017).
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to
a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes'
off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late
May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel
differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a
relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large
set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

Vermilion rockfish are strongly associated with rocky
habitat,i.e., untrawlable habitat, but can be found over soft bottom, especially as
juveniles. This survey spans the entire West Coast and provided data for both the northern
and southern California assessments. However, this survey does not sample most rocky habitats, nor does the survey conduct sampling within the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) or the California state MPA network.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.} Vermilion rockfish are not found in high abundance in this survey, and in most
cases lengths for the entire catch were available, i.e., few enough individuals were caught that
all were measured. The assessment north of Point Conception includes 467 ages, which
is the majority of the vermilion rockfish with available length information (587 total).
South of Point Conception, 1,283 of the 1,962 vermilion observed and measured were also aged.
The length compositions by year of vermilion from the WCGBT survey are shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-data-NWFSC-TWL}.

\emph{Maturity samples.} Maturity samples were analyzed by by Melissa Head (NWFSC) and a
description of the results is in the section on biological data.

\emph{Index of abundance.} The index was considered, but not used in the pre-STAR base model. Sample
sizes of vermilion rockfish were low. A VAST model was attempted and did not converge
for either the northern or southern California data. The STAT also developed
a delta-glm model for each area (north and south of Point Conception). Full details
of the final index are in the Appendix, including
sample sizes, model selection criteria, and model diagnostics.

chartered commercial vessels and NOAA research vessels.

Even though samples were collected via multiple gear types, they were combined for use
in the assessment.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.}
A total of 229 vermilion were aged from this survey from samples in 2004-2005.
The length composition includes 355 vermilion from these surveys
(Figures \ref{fig:len-data-SWFSC-GF-ECOL}).

\hypertarget{j.-abrams-thesis-data}{%
\subsubsection{J. Abrams thesis data}\label{j.-abrams-thesis-data}}

For his master's thesis work at Humboldt State University, Jeff Abrams conducted fishery-independent
hook-and-line surveys in 2010 and 2011 off of California's North Coast (Abrams 2014). Sites were randomly sampled from
areas of known rocky habitat within six depth by distance-from-port strata out of three ports:
Crescent City Harbor, Trinidad Bay and Noyo River Harbor. The otoliths collected as part of this
study are valuable for nearshore groundfish stock assessments that are often lacking biological samples,
especially from the North Coast. This collection resides at the SWFSC Santa Cruz lab.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.}
All 81 vermilion collected during the survey were aged and represent the most northern biological
samples in this model. The available length composition in Figure

\hypertarget{california-collaborative-fisheries-research-project}{%
\subsubsection{California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project}\label{california-collaborative-fisheries-research-project}}

Since 2007, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project (CCFRP)
has monitored several areas in California to
evaluate the performance of MPAs and understand nearshore fish populations
(Wendt and Starr 2009; Starr et al. 2015). In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four
MPAs in central California
(Año Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas)
to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV)s guided by one of
the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location:
Humboldt State University;
Bodega Marine Laboratories;
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories;
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo;
University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within
randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside MPAs.
Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and released or descended to depth;
since then, some have been retained for biological collections including otoliths and fin clips.
This is the only long term fisheries-independent data series that spans the entire California
coast (although coastwide coverage is limited to recent years) and provides relative abundance and demographic data on fish stocks within California's network of MPAs.

\textbf{Available Data}

\emph{Age and Length Data.} A total of 48 otolithsfrom the CCFRP survey were available, but not included in the
assessment model due to low
annual sample sizes. The composition of length data from 4,344 vermilion encountered
in the CCFRP survey is in Figure @ref(fig:len\_data\_REC-CCFRP).

\emph{Index of Abundance}
The index of abundance in the pre-STAR base model is based on a Bayesian negative binomial
model, and the posterior predictions were weighted with the assumption that 20\% of
the available habitat within California state waters (0-3 nm) is within MPAs.
The SWFSC has worked extensively on quantifying rocky habitat from high resolution
bathymetric data collected as part of the Seafloor Mapping Program. The quantification
of habitat has been used in a number of stock assessments to weight indices of abundance
since 2013. This is the first time the habitat data are utilized to weight an inside/outside
MPA effet within an index. Full details on the observed data, model selection and modeling
methods can be found in the Appendix.

\hypertarget{additional-considered-data-sources}{%
\subsection{Additional Considered Data Sources}\label{additional-considered-data-sources}}

The STAT considered the following studies as possible data sources, but found that Vermilion rockfish were not well sampled and no further analysis was conducted.

\emph{NWFSC Triennial Survey}

The Triennial Survey was first conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in 1977, and the survey
continued until 2004 (Dark and Wilkins 1994).
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across
the continental shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower
than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the
data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to
36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the
southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and
surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the Triennial Survey series, the NWFSC FRAM
conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

\emph{Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey}

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey operated during the months of October to November aboard the
R/V \emph{Miller Freeman}.
Partial survey coverage of the US West Coast occurred during the years 1988-1996
and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the
years 1997 and 1999-2001.
Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included
in assessments.

\emph{Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans}

The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans,
\href{http://www.piscoweb.org/kelp-forest-study}{PISCO-UCSC}, conducts a number of surveys
to monitor the kelp forests, one of which is a kelp forest fish survey. PISCO
has monitored fish population in the 0-20 m depth range as part of the
Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) since 1998. Paired sites inside and outside MPAs
are surveyed to monitor the long-term dynamics of the kelp forest ecosystem and provide
insight into the effect of MPAs on kelp forest species. PISCO conducts the fish
surveys from late July through September. At each site, benthic, midwater, and canopy
scuba transects are conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 20 m depth. All divers are trained
in species identification. Along each 30 m transect, divers enumerate all identifiable
non-cryptic fish, and measure total length to the nearest centimeter. PISCO surveys
are conducted by the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in central California and
through the University of California Santa Barbara in southern California.

\emph{California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations}

The CalCOFI surveys began in 1951 and conducts quarterly cruises off southern \&
central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data on
station and underway. Ichthyoplankon sampling with a paired bongo started in 1978.
Data on larval abundance from the CalCOFI Ichthyoplankton survey have been used in
stock assessments of several species, including bocaccio, cowcod and shortbelly
rockfish. Although the long-term dataset is limited to a small subset of species
for which morphological identification of larvae has been possible, recent research
has been successful at identifying a broader range of species based on genetic
identification of larvae (Thompson et al. 2016).
Vermilion rockfish cannot be identified morphologically in the ichthyoplankton
samples. Of over 20,000 larvae identified in the 1998-2013 time period, only nine
were vermilion rockfish, encountered in only about 1\% of the hauls. Consequently,
the data are insufficient at this time to use to inform relative abundance, although Thompson et al. (2017) do provide several relative abundance time series for other taxa, and
future efforts may lead to better taxonomic resolution of historical or future collections.

\emph{Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Survey}

Since 1983, the SWFSC has conducted an annual midwater trawl survey for pelagic
juvenile rockfish and other groundfish in the Central California region of the
California Current (Ralston et al. (2013) and references therein). Due to concerns
about mesoscale abundance patterns and a need for greater spatial representation
in the data, including some apparent strong differences in spatial distribution
patterns in the early 2000s (Hastie and Ralston 2007; S. Ralston, Sakuma, and Field 2013), this survey was expanded
to a broader spatial scale in the 2001-2004 period, and since 2004 most years have
coastwide data from a combination of SWFSC, NWFSC and Cooperative Research surveys
(see Field et al. (2021) for more complete details regarding coastwide
pre-recruit data, and Sakuma et al. (2016) and Friedman et al. (2018)
for additional details and alternative applications of survey data).

\hypertarget{biology}{%

\hypertarget{ageing-precision-and-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Ageing Precision and Bias}\label{ageing-precision-and-bias}}

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish
otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the
SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \ref{fig:reader1reader2}).
Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described
above. The same readers aged otoliths for both vermilion rockfish stock assessment models.
Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read
otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these
two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts
(CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software (Thorson, Stewart, and Punt 2012).
The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more
experienced. The \(\Delta AIC\) among the top three models was less than two. The
best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard
deviation for both readers.\\
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2
selected the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation
(Figure \ref{fig:oldfish}). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence
interval using this model (Figure \ref{fig:truereads}).The latter model was selected
for use in the assessment and the distribution of true age and observed
age is in Figure \ref{fig:ageerror}.

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings
increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70,
the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.

\hypertarget{maturity}{%
\subsubsection{Maturity}\label{maturity}}

Maturity at length of nominal vermilion rockfish was previously studied by Wyllie Echeverria (1987) (1988) from fish collected off central California. She found that 50\% of females sampled were mature by 37 cm total length, and 50\% of males were mature by 38 cm total length. Love et al.~(1990) (1990) reported 37 cm total length for female size at 50\% maturity, based on fish collected in southern California. Phillips (1964) (1964) reported a size at 50\% maturity of 13 inches (33 cm) total length, although the sampling location of the fish used to determine maturity for that study was not specified within California.

For the current assessment, Melissa Head (NWFSC, pers. comm.) determined maturity
for 545 female vermilion rockfish caught by recent fishery-independent surveys. Two types
of maturity determinations were provided, `biological maturity' and `functional
maturity.' The former category includes ``juveniles exhibiting dummy runs (early
vitellogenesis or yolk granules present in a small proportion of oocytes, some
in early stages of cellular decay) and skip spawners (adults foregoing spawning
in a given year)'' (M. Head, pers. comm.), while the latter excludes such cases.
A logistic regression wa sfit to the functional maturity determination as a function of fork length (Figure \ref{fig:fitted-fecundity}), estimating LMAT at 38.4 cm , with a slope of -0.312,
based on the parameterization in Stock Synthesis. The samples available from areas north of Pt. Conception were smaller fish and did not allow for estimates of separate
maturity curves. Both California vermilion assessments assumed the same maturity
ogive (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).

\hypertarget{fecundity}{%
\subsubsection{Fecundity}\label{fecundity}}

Phillips (1964) (1964) reported fecundity for nominal ``vermilion'' rockfish collected in waters off California. Based on a sample of 12 fish ranging in size from 315-550 mm total length, he reported the maximum and minimum number of eggs as 1,625,600 and 63,300 per female, respectively. Love et al. (1990) estimated fecundity of fish in southern California, and reported a allometric fecundity - length relationship (eggs vs.~total length, cm) with an exponent of 5.02, suggesting a significant increase in weight-specific fecundity with female size given a roughly cubic weight-length relationship. Dick et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of Sebastes fecundity-length relationships. Insufficient data were available to model the subgenus \emph{Rosicola}, but the predictive distribution of the fecundity-length exponent for the genus as whole centered around a value of 4, supporting a general pattern of increasing weight-specific fecundity among the Sebastes. Analyses to date have not examined size-dependent changes in brood frequency for vermilion or sunset rockfishes, i.e.~fecundity estimates represent brood fecundity.

For this assessment, new observations of fecundity at length were supplied by S. Beyer (UCSC / SWFSC, pers. comm.). These data were combined with digitized historical data sets mentioned above to estimate a new fecundity-length relationship (Figure here). The relationship between fecundity (millions of eggs) and fork length (cm) estimated from these data and used in the assessment was
\(F = 2.8e^{-9}L^{4.97}\)

The resulting relationship between fecundity by female weight (kg) is in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}, with spawning output at age is in Figure \ref{fig:spawningoutpuage}.

\hypertarget{natural-mortality}{%
\subsubsection{Natural Mortality}\label{natural-mortality}}

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical
relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool
\href{https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool}{NMT}, a Shiny-based
graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural
mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth,
and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently
provides 19 options, including the Hamel (2015) method, which is a corrected
form of the Then et al. (2018) functional regression model and is a commonly
applied method for West Coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction
of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user.

We assumed the age of 54 years to represent the practical longevity (i.e., 90\% of
the commonly seen maximum age of 60) for both females and males, though the absolute
oldest age in Oregon was \textgreater60 years. In the larger biomass, higher sampled area of
California, ages 80+ were even encountered. Empirical \(M\) estimators using the von
Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered, but they produced unreasonably
high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely
explained by the fact that vermilion rockfish have protracted longevity at \(L_{\infty}\).
Additionally, the FishLife (Thorson and Barnett 2017) estimate was included, though, given
the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of
\(M\) are also from methods using longevity, though the actual source of longevity
in FishLife was unknown.
Both California vermilion assessments used the Hamel prior (2015), which
is defined as a lognormal with mean \(ln\frac{5.4}{A_{max}}\) and SE = 0.4384343.
Using a maximum age of 54 the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.1, which
is used as a prior on \(M\) in the assessment model. We also explore sensitivity to
these assumptions of natural mortality through likelihood profiling.

\hypertarget{sex-ratio}{%
\subsubsection{Sex Ratio}\label{sex-ratio}}

The sex ratio was assumed to be 50:50 and plots of the sex ratio by year for data with sex-specific CAAL data are available in Figure \ref{fig:sexratio-ABRAMS-RESEARCH}, Figure \ref{fig:sexratio-SWFSC-GF-ECOL}, and
Figure \ref{fig:sexratio-NWFSC-TWL} along with 75\% intervals calculated as Jeffreys intervals based on adjusted input sample sizes from Francis weighting (Brown, Cai, and DasGupta 2001). The WCGBT survey provided the majority of age data to the assessment and no clear patterns can be seen in the sex ratios. For years with fish larger than 50 cm , the sex ratio is skewed towards females, but the data are too sparse to draw conclusions about the true sex ratio in the population.

\hypertarget{weight-length-relationship}{%
\subsubsection{Weight-Length Relationship}\label{weight-length-relationship}}

In California, the weight(kg)-length(cm) relationship for vermilion rockfish was estimated external the
model using biological data available from fishery-independent
data sources including the NWFSC hook-and-line survey and the WCGBTS. The estimated
weight-length was assumed the same for males and females:
\(W\)=1.744e-05\(L\)\textsuperscript{3}
(Figure \ref{fig:weightlength}).
In Oregon and Washington, the estimated parameters (a,b) of the \(W=aL^b\) relationship were:
- OR Female: 2.60642 e-05, 2.927321
- OR Male: 3.763596 e-05, 2.829314
- WA Female: 0.0000136, 3.1

\subsection{History of Modeling Approaches}\label{history-of-modeling-approaches}}

Vermilion was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using
Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) (E. J. Dick and MacCall 1994). Average catch
2008-2009 was 136.3 mt, and the median OFL in 2010 was 314.3 mt with a 28\%
probability that recent catch exceeded the 2010 (E. J. Dick and MacCall 1994).

A 2005 assessment was not accepted for management.
From the September 2005 \href{https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2005/09/f-groundfish-management-september-2005.pdf/}{Briefing Book}:
``The SSC considers the assessment to be best available science, but at this stage does not
endorse the results as being suitable for setting OYs.'' A 2013 data moderate
assessment was prepared, but not reviewed. From Pacific Coast Groundfish Stock
Assessment Review (STAR) Panel Report For Data-Moderate Assessments (2013):
``There was insufficient time during the review to evaluate all the assessments
originally requested by the Council. Assessments for vermilion/sunset rockfishes
(\emph{Sebastes miniatus} and \emph{Sebastes crocotulus}) and yellowtail rockfish
(south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N$) were not presented by the Stock Assessment Team (STAT).''

\hypertarget{most-recent-star-panel-and-ssc-recommendations}{%
\subsubsection{Most Recent STAR Panel and SSC Recommendations}\label{most-recent-star-panel-and-ssc-recommendations}}

The 2005 STAR panel report compiled recommendations specific to vermilion, and also
generic rockfish recommendations The generic rockfish recommendation are not
presented here. The 2005 assessment was not accepted for management by the PFMC.

\textbf{Vermilion rockfish recommendations}

Investigation into the species composition of nominal vermilion rockfish is needed.
It is not clear that separate assessments for the northern and southern areas are warranted
for vermilion rockfish. Although there were differences in the estimated magnitude and
timing of recruitment events, the estimated stock trends were similar in both areas.
Pooling of data from northern and southern areas may permit a more robust assessment
model to be obtained.

\emph{2021 STAT response.} Since the 2005 assessment, vermilion rockfish were speciated
to vermilion and sunset rockfishes (J. R. Hyde and Vetter 2009). Sunset rockfish are more common south of
Pt. Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) and historical catches and length distributions between
the two areas are different. The STAT discussed this at the Pre-Assessment workshop
and all participants agreed that modeling the areas separately was an appropriate
decision.

\subsubsection{Response to STAR Panel Requests (not required in draft)}\label{response-to-star-panel-requests-not-required-in-draft}}

\hypertarget{model-specifications}{%
\subsection{Model Specifications}\label{model-specifications}}

A decision was made by the STAT after discussions with the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Groundfish Management Team and Groundfish Advisory Panel to model the areas north and south of Point Conception independently for a number of reasons. This included a discussion of the assumed higher densities of sunset rockfish south of Point Conception and the general decline in vermilion rockfish density as latitude increases. The preliminary exploration of length data also suggested that the size composition of landed fish north and south of Point Conception differed in a number of fleets. The STAT did maintain consistency across the two models when the data supported the decisions, i.e., maintaining the same recreational and commercial fleet structures and sharing biological data from the more data-rich southern assessment.

The commercial fleet catches includes dead discards, which were a small percent of the overall landings in both areas (averaging 7.4 mt coastwide since 2015, although increasing since 2017). In addition, there were very little data available from WCGOP. There are four recreational fleets representing retained and assumed-dead discard catches for the PC and PR fleets. This follows the same practice as a number of other recent rockfish stock assessments in recent years, where the ability to accurately estimate a retention curve is masked by depth-dependent mortality rates. Vermilion rockfish is a desirable species in the recreational fleet and the majority of available lengths from discarded fish from the CDFW and Cal Poly observer programs were regulatory discards from trips when the groundfish fishery was closed and were not representative of discards in the recreational fleet.

The specifications of the California models north and south of Point Conception are very similar. The major differences between the two models are the availability of fishery-independent data sources that are region specific.

The fishery-independent data used to estimate the weight-length relationship and the maturity ogive were mainly derived from data collected south of Point Conception, and the parameters were shared across both models.

The specification of the California models north and south of Point Conception
are very similar. The major differences between the to models are the availability
of fishery-independent data sources that are region specific.

The Vermilion rockfish assessment north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime N$) off the coast of California is assessed using a two-sex model with sex-specific growth.

The model assumed seven fishing fleets with removals beginning in 1875:

\emph{Commercial}: There are three commercial fleets; hook-and-line, trawl, and net.
All of the commercial fleets represented landed dead catch and assumed dead discards.

\emph{Recreational}: There are four recreational fleets. Each of the PC and PR modes have
separate fleets for retained and discarded catch. This decision was driven by the
length compositions between retained
and discarded fish (with discarded fish on average smaller than retained fish).

\emph{Fishery-Dependent Surveys}: There are four fishery-dependent survey fleets north
of Point Conception; 1) the MRFSS CPFV dockside survey, 2) Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard observer survey, 3)CDFW/Cal Poly onboard observer survey, and 4) CRFS PR1 dockside survey.

\emph{Research}: There are three research fleets; 1) Abrams conditional-length-at-age data,
2) NWFSC WCGBT survey data, and 3) SWFSC groundfish ecology survey data.

\hypertarget{additional-specifications}{%
\subsubsection{Additional Specifications}\label{additional-specifications}}

Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for all fleets. Selectivities were estimated for the commercial hook-and-line fleet, commercial trawl fleet, and the commercial net fleet. Selectivity was estimated for the recreational PC fleet, recreational PC discard fleet and the Recreational PR fleet. There were no length data available for the recreational PR fleet, and it mirrors the selectivity of the recreational PC discard fleet.
Selectivity for the recreational PC onboard index of abundance is mirrored to the recreational
PC fleet as they share the same length composition. The Abrams research selectivity mirrors the
commercial hook-and-line fleet. The STAT explored mirroring this data set to the recreational PC fleet, but the length composition was more representative of the commercial fleet. The Abrams dataset was too sparse and only collected over a two year period. Hook-and-line gear was the
dominant collection method for teh SWFSC groundfish ecology survey and is mirrored to the commercial hook-and-line fleet.

Selectivity parameters were estimated for all fishery-independent data sources.

The recreational PC and PR fleets applied three time blocks for selectivity: \texttt{r\ startyr} - \texttt{r\ time\_blocks\$Yr{[}1{]}-1}, \texttt{r\ time\_blocks\$Yr{[}1{]}} - \texttt{r\ time\_blocks\$Yr{[}2{]}-1}, - \texttt{r\ time\_blocks\$Yr{[}2{]}} - \texttt{r\ endyr}. All commercial fleet selectivity was constant across model years \texttt{r\ startyr} - \texttt{r\ endyr}.

The length composition data for some years and fleets was small, and may not be
representative of the total catch. Length composition data were removed from the
model if fewer than 10 fish were measured in a given
year and fleet. Initial input sample sizes were also capped at x00 for each set of length composition data.

The time-series of landings begins in 1875 for the commercial fleet and in 1916 for
the recreational fleet. This captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is
assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.

The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-70, where age 70 is the `plus-group.'
There are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 28.
The population length bins and the length composition length bins are set at 2-cm bins from
fish 10-70 cm fork length.

The first year of recruitment deviations begins in \texttt{r}min(model\(recruitpars\)Yr)`, with 1963 as the last year
of early recruitment deviations with no bias adjustment and 1980 as the first year
with full bias adjustment.

\hypertarget{modeling-platform-and-structure}{%
\subsubsection{Modeling Platform and Structure}\label{modeling-platform-and-structure}}

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16.00 developed by
Dr.~Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC (Methot and Wetzel 2013). This most recent
version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older
model versions. The R package \href{https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss}{r4ss}, version
1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits.

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness (\(h\); beta distribution with \(\mu\)=0.72 and \(\sigma\)=0.15) is retained.

\hypertarget{data-weighting}{%
\subsubsection{Data Weighting}\label{data-weighting}}

Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for
the base model were tuned by the ``Francis method,'' based on equation TA1.8 in Francis
(2011), and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing
the residuals in the model's expected mean length with respect to the observed mean
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0.

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method (McAllister, Murdoch K.; Ianelli 1997). Additionally, weighting
using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta)
that scales the input sample size, was explored. However, all estimates of the ratio of
\(\theta/(1+\theta)\) were greater than 0.99, which indicates the models is trying to tune
the sample size as high as possible. Given this result, the STAT chose not to further explore
the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting. As a note, there is a bug in SS Version 3.30.16.00 that
prevents the number of estimated weights from being larger than the number of fleets. This was
fixed in SS Version 3.30.16.01 and this version was only used for exploration of the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting.

The STAT explored both McAllister-Ianelli and Francis data weighting methods with the

\subsubsection{Key Assumptions and Structural Choices}\label{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}}

A key assumption made by this assessment model is that the biological parameters between the cryptic species pair vermilion and sunset rockfish are the same. The catch histories are inseparable at this time, especially for
the early commercial landings. Ongoing research may shed light on this issue.

\hypertarget{evaluation-of-model-parameters}{%
\subsubsection{Evaluation of Model Parameters}\label{evaluation-of-model-parameters}}

A number of models were explored to look the the first year of estimated recruitment deviations.

Models estimating steepness were also considered.

\hypertarget{convergence}{%
\subsubsection{Convergence}\label{convergence}}

Model convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed
values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better
minimum. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal
distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range (Methot, R. D. et al. 2020). This
was repeated 300 times and the minimum was reached in 67\% of the runs (Figure \ref{fig:jitter}).
The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001,
when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting
the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability. We did sensitivity runs for
convergence by changing the phases for key estimated parameters; neither the total
log-likelihood nor the parameter estimates changed.

\section{Assessment Results}\label{assessment-results}}

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:parms}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}.

\hypertarget{parameter-estimates}{%
\subsection{Parameter Estimates}\label{parameter-estimates}}

The base model has a total of 115 estimated parameters
(Figure \ref{tab:params}) that can be grouped into the following
categories and are described in more detail in the following sections:

Biological parameters\\
- 1 natural mortality parameter (female and male assumed the same)\\
- 8 growth parameters, where the Age at Lmin and CV for old ma
- 3 Schnute growth parameters (length at age 0, length at age 30, and \(k\))\\
- 3 parameters controlling variability in growth, the CV in length at age 0\\
and the CV in length at age 30 with a linear ramp in length-at-age (CV for young males was not estimated)

Stock-recruit parameters\\
- \texttt{r\ 2\ +\ nrow(model\$recruit)} recruitment parameters\\
- \(log(R_0)\) controlling equilibrium recruitment\\
- \texttt{r\ nrow(model\$recruit)} recruitment deviations parameters covering the range\\
\texttt{r\ min(model\$recruit\$Yr)}-\texttt{r\ max(model\$recruit\$Yr)}, with
\texttt{r\ min(model\$recruit\$Yr{[}model\$recruit\$era=="Main"{]})}-\texttt{r\ max(model\$recruit\$Yr{[}model\$recruit\$era=="Main"{]})}
representing the ``main'' period modeled as a zero-centered deviation vector

Index parameters\\
- \texttt{r\ sum(sum(grepl("Q\_extra",\ estimated\_pars)))} extra standard deviation parameters
for indices

Selectivity parameters\\
- \texttt{r\ sum(grepl("Size\_DblN",\ estimated\_pars))} selectivity parameters, of which
\texttt{r\ sum(grepl("Size\_DblN.*BLK",\ estimated\_pars))} represented changes over time

\hypertarget{fixed-parameters}{%

\item
  \(h\) controlling the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship
\item
  \(M\) for males
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{natural-mortality-1}{%
\subsection{Natural Mortality}\label{natural-mortality-1}}

Female natural mortality was estimated at 0.09 and male natural mortality was fixed at the female-estimated value.

\hypertarget{growth-length-at-age}{%
\subsection{Growth (Length-at-Age)}\label{growth-length-at-age}}

Internal estimates of growth were estimated directly for males, and not as an offset. An offset for male growth was explored, but the CV of length at \(L_{age=30}\) was estimated around 2-3\%. When the male CV was fixed to female CV, the assessment model shrunk the CV of females at \(L_{age=30}\), which the STAT did not find reasonable. Therefore, the male CV at \(L_{age=30}\) was fixed at the CV estimated for females of 0.07 (Figure \ref{fig:fittedgrowth}).

The direct estimation of male \(L_{age=0}=6.02\) was reasonable compared to female \(L_{age=0}=7.8\). While \(k\) was estimated larger for males (0.19) than females (0.15), female size at t \(L_{age=30}\) of 55 cm was larger than males at 79 cm. These results are consistent with other studies that have looked at sex-specific growth in vermilion rockfish.

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 55.4 cm; $k$ = 0.145; $t_0$ = -0.53

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 49.9 cm; $k$ = 0.199; $t_0$ = -0.15

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model, 2020.
Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) was
140.88 mt when using an \(SPR_{50\%}\)
reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40\% of the unfished level (\(SB_{40\%}\)) was 497.31
million eggs.

The predicted spawning output from the base model shows frogs (Figure \ref{fig:ssb}). The spawning output then frogs.

The 2020. spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished levels (Figure \ref{fig:depl}).
The relative fishing intensity, \((1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})\), was above the management target frogs (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). The relative fishing intensity has been frogs (Figure \ref{fig:phase}).

Table \ref{tab:ref-pts} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figures \ref{fig:yield2} and \ref{fig:yield3} show the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

\section{Assessment Model Diagnostics}\label{assessment-model-diagnostics}}

Describe all diagnostics

\hypertarget{sensitivity-to-assumptions-data-and-weighting}{%
\subsection{Sensitivity to Assumptions, Data and, Weighting}\label{sensitivity-to-assumptions-data-and-weighting}}

To better understand how data from individual fishery sectors or scientific surveys affected assessment results, we excluded data sets from the likelihood, one fleet at a time (referred to here as a ``drop-one'' analysis). ``Fleet'' in this sense refers to either a fishing fleet or a survey ``fleet.'' To do this, we set ``lambdas'' (multipliers for each likelihood component) equal to zero. This is equivalent to removing the data from the model. When composition data were excluded, the selectivity parameters for that fleet were fixed at the base model estimates to standardize the size and age composition of harvested fish. When abundance indices were excluded, relevant catchability and `extraSE' parameters associated with the index were not estimated. Composition data weights for the remaining fleets were kept consistent with the base model values. Results from all the `drop-one' runs were compared to the base model using time series plots and tables containing likelihood components, parameter estimates and derived quantities.

Drop-one analysis of the northern California assessment revealed slightly larger variability in spawning output trends relative to the south, but all runs were still within the range of uncertainty estimated by the base model (Figure \ref{drop-spawnbio}). Removal of most fleets had little effect on terminal stock status, with best estimates in the vicinity of target biomass levels (Figure \ref{drop-bratio}). An exception was removal of the REC\_PC fleet, which caused the best estimate of terminal depletion to drop just above the minimum stock size threshold. This suggests that the REC\_PC data sets, together, favor a less-depleted stock relative to data from the other fleets. The strength of the 2016 year class is sensitive to the removal of fleet-specific data sets (Figure \ref{fig:recdev}). Removal of the REC\_PR fleet produces the largest estimates of 2016 cohort size, and removal of the NWFSC\_TWL fleet estimates a 2016 deviation that is less than half as large (but still positive). Uncertainty in the strength of this recent year class should be taken into consideration for short term forecasts of stock abundance and yield. Changes in likelihoods, parameter estimates and derived quantities are recorded in Table \ref{tab:drop-one}. Comparison of likelihoods among drop-one scenarios should be treated with caution due to changes in the data sets that were fit in each model run.

\hypertarget{likelihood-profiles}{%
\subsection{Likelihood Profiles}\label{likelihood-profiles}}

Likelihood profiles were conducted for natural mortality (M), steepness (h) and the log of R0 (unfished recruitment) by fixing these parameters across a range of values and continuing to estimate the remaining parameters assuming the base model framework.

\hypertarget{retrospective-analysis}{%
\subsection{Retrospective Analysis}\label{retrospective-analysis}}

A five year retrospective analysis was conducted on the northern base model by sequentially removing data, beginning with data from the year 2020. Figures \ref{fig:retro-spawnb}, \ref{fig:retro-bratio}, and \ref{fig:retro-recdev} show the estimated spawning output, the estimated depletion, the recruitment deviation estimates and the estimated fit to the CCFRP index (which was the index most affected by the analysis). The greatest impact of sequentially removing recent data was the declining estimate of the strength of the 2016 year class, a result similar to the southern model, as the length composition and index data that informed those year classes were removed. There was also a slightly lesser reduction in the strength of the 2013 and 2014 year classes. However, aside from a modest rescaling upwards of recruitment deviations, the spawning output and depletion estimates did not change by any significant measure, suggesting no concerning retrospective patterns (Table \ref{tab:retro}). Note that data weighting was not conducted on these models.

\hypertarget{other-model-sensitivities}{%
\subsection{Other Model Sensitivities}\label{other-model-sensitivities}}

{[}This paragraph can go in both docs{]}
Results from the pre-STAR base model were compared to several alternative model specifications, as described below.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate the Beverton-Holt steepness parameter (\emph{h}) rather than fixing it at the prior mean (\emph{h}=0.72); estimate uncertainty intervals for comparison to base
\item
  Start recruitment deviations 5 years earlier than the base model configuration
\item
  Start recruitment deviations 5 years later than the base model configuration
\item
  Compare results based on the McAllister-Ianelli data weighting method (for composition data) to the Francis method used for the base model.
\item
  Mirror the recreational discard fleets' selectivity curves to the corresponding retained fleets (PC or PR) rather than fitting to discard length comps as in the base model.
\end{itemize}

Trends in spawning output for the northern California assessment model were generally robust to this set of sensitivities (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-spawnbio}). Best estimates from all runs were within the estimated range of uncertainty for the base model. Steepness was estimated at a higher value than the prior mean (estimated at 0.94 vs.~fixed at 0.72). Similarly, stock status did not vary greatly among this set of sensitivity runs, with only a minor increase in 2021 relative spawning output when using McAllister-Ianelli weights and a slight decrease when estimating steepness (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-bratio}). The use of McAllister-Ianelli weights had the greatest impact on estimated recruitment deviations (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-recdev}). This weighting method significantly reduced the magnitude of the 2016 year class, and generally increased the variance of the estimated deviations. The McAllister-Ianelli method gives greater weight to the composition data for this model (Table YYY), and resulted in lower estimates of the male and female natural mortality rates (Table \ref{tab:sens1}).

Trends in spawning output for the southern California assessment model were generally robust to this set of sensitivities, with the exception of recent estimates of spawning output which were much lower when using McAllister-Ianelli data weights, relative to the Francis method used in the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-spawnbio}). The model tuned to McAllister-Ianelli weights was below target biomass, while the other models that used Francis weights showed similar trends in depletion and were above target biomass (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-bratio}). The McAllister-Ianelli approach estimated a natural mortality rate that was about 20\% lower than the Francis method (Table ZZZ). Best estimates from all runs were within the estimated range of uncertainty for the base model. Steepness in the southern region was estimated at a similar value than the prior mean (estimated at 0.77 vs.~fixed at 0.72), and estimation of this parameter did not have a large effect on uncertainty in spawning output or recruitment deviations. The use of McAllister-Ianelli weights had the greatest impact on estimated recruitment deviations (Figure \ref{fig:sens1-recdev}). This weighting method increased the variance of the estimated deviations as well as the estimated strength of the 1999 year class, relative to the models using the Francis approach. Changing the start date of the recruitment deviations had almost no effect. The McAllister-Ianelli method gives greater weight to the composition data for this model (Table \ref{tab:sens1}).

\hypertarget{regional-management-and-spatial-management-considerations}{%
\subsection{Regional Management and Spatial Management Considerations}\label{regional-management-and-spatial-management-considerations}}

Over the last several decades, spatially explicit management measures at both the state and federal/management council level have been implemented to achieve a wide range of marine resource and fishery management objectives. Depth restrictions to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) and the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) are key among those, as are the suite of total and partial exclusion of commercial and recreational fishing activities in the California statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). While the former are associated with explicit fisheries management objectives, the latter have a suite of ecological and economic objectives, most of which are not specific to, nor integrated across, the fisheries management arena. Despite this, both types of spatial management measures are expected to result in various biological, ecological, and socioeconomic effects within and adjacent to their boundaries. All of these effects have the potential to influence the nature and quality of the data used to inform stock assessments of species that reside in these areas, including vermilion rockfish.

Regardless of the management objective, spatial closures are expected to increase the spatial heterogeneity in abundance and size or age structure of fished stocks. This greater spatial variability can complicate the assumptions made in stock assessment models, particularly the assumption that the densities and demographic structure of assessed populations are relatively homogenous, at least across predictable habitat types such as bathymetric gradients or substrate types (\textbf{Punt2004?}; \textbf{Field2007?}; \textbf{Berger2017?}). Although a wide range of factors above and beyond spatial management measures can also lead to violations of those assumptions, and the challenge is intuitively less problematic for populations with high movement rates and/or high population turnover, the challenge can be particularly important for longer lived populations with lower movement rates. The challenge can best be summarized by the result that the more effective MPAs or other closed areas are at protecting populations within them, the more likely it is that traditional assessment approaches will be biased or more uncertain.

If the spatial closures also prevent fisheries independent surveys from evaluating the relative abundance and demographic structure of managed populations, the challenges in developing robust population models, and thus robust management advice, become even more severe. While spatially explicit assessment models provide a means of more explicitly addressing these challenges, such models are computationally intensive, require robust data from the specific areas being modeled, and may also require detailed information regarding movement and dispersal rates (McGilliard et al. 2014; \textbf{Berger2017?}; \textbf{Puntet2020?}; \textbf{Cadrin2020?}). Moreover, the complexity of these spatial models increases substantially if the size and location of closed areas changes over time, as many of the more ``fisheries management based'' closures (e.g., RCAs) have in California groundfish fisheries. Thus, such approaches may be less feasible for more data limited stocks, such as northern and southern vermilion rockfish, at least in the near term. However, the fact that both the northern and southern assessment models are informed by fishery-independent surveys that include habitats both inside and outside area closures provides some hope for greater recognition of spatial factors in future assessments.

\hypertarget{unresolved-problems-and-major-uncertainties-2}{%
\section{Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties}\label{unresolved-problems-and-major-uncertainties-2}}

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the
  vermilion/sunset complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within
  a single species and also between the two species. Little biological data for south of
  Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed
  to better under biological parameters.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Conduct life history studies
  \item
    Conduct research to identify the proportion of each species in population and in catches
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Take a closer look at the Ralston historical catch reconstruction (\cite{Ralston2010}) and
  all other historical data sources.
\item
  Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including
  a hierarchical structure and random effects. The CCFRP survey is the only
  fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky
  reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available,
  and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored
  since 2007.
\item
  Continue to investigate the most appropriate model structure for the NWFSC HL survey index.
  The NWFSC HL survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat
  in the Southern California Bight. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey index given its expansion into the CCA, also independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey.Increased spatiotemporal sampling around Pt. Conception would aid in identifying stock boundaries.
\item
  Utilize existing ROV survey data sources

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    SWFSC Submersible Survey of the Cowcod Conservation Areas (Yoklavich, Love, and Forney 2007).
  \item
    This was a line-transect survey designed to estimate cowcod abundance in 2002
    conducted from a submersible inside the CCAs. Originally, only cowcod were enumerated from the video footage. Over the last few years, the SWFSC has re-analyzed the video footage to enumerate other rockfish species.
  \item
    The SWFSC Fishery Resource Division (FRD) conducted a survey of potential cowcod habitat between Point Conception and the U.S. -- Mexico border from October through December of 2012 (Stierhoff and Cutter 2013).
  \item
    SWFSC staff are submitting proposals to conduct an additional submirsible survey in the southern California Bight
  \item
    CDFW ROV survey data
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Collection of length and age data are recommended for both the commercial and
  recreational fisheries. Very little age data are available from either fishery for
  vermilion and sunset rockfishes.
\item
  Investigate possible environmental drivers/co-variates for biological parameters,
  particularly for recruitment.
\item
  Resolve differences between CalCOM and PacFIN expanded length composition data sets.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index, 1980-1999}\label{mrfss-dockside-cpfv-index-1980-1999}}

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of
recreational CPFV fishing fleet. No MRFSS CPUE data are available for the years
1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. Sampling of
California CPFVs north of Point Conception was further delayed, and CPFV samples
n 1993 and 1994 are limited to San Luis Obispo County.
For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series was truncated at 1999 due
to sampling overlap with the
onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while
onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for
the same vessel).

Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a
single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a
subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also
identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers
being interviewed. The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded.
The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records
belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials
(``Identifying Trips in RecFIN'').

\textbf{MRFSS CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

Trips recorded as having the primary area fished in Mexico or occurring in bays, e.g.,
San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition.
For indices representing only north of Pt. Conception, the years 1993-1994 were
excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall (2004) filtering approach was used to predict the
probability of of catching vermilion, based
on the species composition of the sampler observed catch in a given trip. Prior
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative
predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage
(at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model. The remaining
25 all co-occurred with vermilion in at least one trip
and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients
from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive
for species that are more likely to co-occur with vermilion,
and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with vermilion
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-sm-mrfss}).
The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with vermilion include
Gopher, Flag, Copper, Canary, and Starry rockfishes, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp
habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were
Chinook salmon, Widow and Greenspotted rockfishes, Chub mackerel and Rosy rockfish.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species
assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of
more than one species or species complex (``mixed trips'') can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch
that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall
(2004) recommended including all trips above a threshold where the
false negatives and false positives are equally balanced. However, this does
not have any biological relevance and for this data set, we assume that if a
vermilion was landed, the anglers had to have fished in appropriate habitat,
especially given vermilion is strongly associated with rocky habitat.

The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence
at which the rate of ``false
positives'' equals ``false negatives'' of 0.35. The
trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method
including all the ``false positive'' trips, regardless of the probability of
encountering vermilion.
This assumes that if vermilion were caught, the anglers must have fished in
appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is
``sampler-examined'' and the samplers are well trained in species identification.

Stephens and MacCall proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index
standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives
and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch
a vermilion based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False
negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a vermilion, given the
catch composition, but caught at least one. The threshold probability that
balances FP and FN excludes
1182
trips that did not catch a vermilion (52\%
of the trips), and 188
trips (8\% of the data) that
caught a vermilion. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that
catching a vermilion indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing
effort occurred in habitat where vermilion occur. Only ``true negatives''
(the 1182
trips that neither caught vermilion, nor were predicted to catch them by the model)
were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included
1083 trips, 70\%
of which encountered vermilion. Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-region-mrfss} and \ref{tab:tab-year-mrfss}.

\textbf{MRFSS CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be
ill-fitting and the proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial
models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that
a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch
per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model.
Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves)
and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore \textless3 nm, offshore \textgreater3 nm)
factors were evaluated. Two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte
to Santa Cruz (``N'') and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo (``C'') north of Pt. Conception.
For models that span counties north and south of Pt. Conception, Santa Barbara to
San Diego counties compose a third region (``S''). For models tha exclusively south
of Pt. Conception, the region represent individual counties. Indices with a year
and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average
CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss}).

A Lognormal model was
selected for the positive observation GLM by
a \(\Delta AIC\) of 62.35 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss}). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-mrfss}),
a main effects model including
YEAR and SubRegion
was fit for the binomial model and a main
effects model including
NA
was fit for the Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-mrfss} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-mrfss}). The binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the
30\%
zeroes in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-mrfss}).
The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models
can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-mrfss} and
\ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-mrfss}). The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-mrfss})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-mrfss}).

\subsection{California Onboard CPFV Index of Abundance}\label{california-onboard-cpfv-index-of-abundance}}

\hypertarget{califronia-onboard-observer-survey-1999-2019}{%
\subsubsection{Califronia Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019}\label{califronia-onboard-observer-survey-1999-2019}}

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling
program in 1999 (M. H. Monk, Dick, and Pearson 2014). California Polytechnic State University (Cal
Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows
the protocols established in Reilly et al. (1998).

During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records
location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset
of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a
maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.\\
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather
to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and
ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures
discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter
the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for vermilion.
Cal Poly has modified protocols reflect sampling changes that CDFW
has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at
the level of a fisher's bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in
the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019. The only difference is that
Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either
CDFW or Cal Poly in 2020.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical
in that the same protocols are followed. The only difference is that Cal Poly
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index
selectivity is mirrored to the recreational
fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead)
fish. Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length
from CDFW sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and indlucded in the
length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model.

A number of filters are applied to these data. All of the Cal Poly data were
QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the
data from CDFW. Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and
staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data.

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from
the \href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project},
with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution. Reefs were
developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material
(``Reef Delineation''). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly
consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts
north of Pt. Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-depthfished-cpfvonboard}. The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are
outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger
areas considered as a factor in the index.

We retained 4481 drifts for index standardization, with
1706 drifts encountering vermilion
(Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-cpfvonboard}).

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-region-cpfvonboard}, \ref{tab:tab-depth-cpfvonboard}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-cpfvonboard}.

\textbf{California CPFV CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour)
a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar
in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-cpfvonboard}).

A Lognormal model was
selected for the positive observation GLM by
a \(\Delta AIC\) of 122.41 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-cpfvonboard}). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-cpfvonboard}),
a main effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin
was fit for the binomial model and a main
effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin
was fit for the Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-cpfvonboard} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-cpfvonboard}). The binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the 62\% zeroes in the observed data
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-cpfvonboard}). The predicted marginal effects from
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-cpfvonboard} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-cpfvonboard}). The
final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-cpfvonboard})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-cpfvonboard}).

\subsubsection{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index}\label{deb-wilson-vandenberg-index}}

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted
by CDFW survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, (Reilly et al. 1998)). During an onboard
observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific
catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers
onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15
people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop. The catch cannot be
linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler
also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting
and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort
data allow us to better filter the data for indices
to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.

\textbf{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data
sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database (Melissa H. Monk et al. 2016).
The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop were recorded at a finer
scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location
information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch
information. Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers
was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the
vessel is available. We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number
of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing
stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for
details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore
excluded from the analysis (Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-debwv}). Sampling
targeted areas of central California. Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of
those launched from port in District 6, which was removed from the analysis.

Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps
and interpretation of hard bottom was extracted from
the \href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}.
Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes;
Ft. Bragg to Santa Cruz (V1), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V2), San Luis Obispo to
Pt. Conception (V3), and Offshore (deeper) locations including the Farallon
Islands and reefs of Half Moon Bay and Monterey Bay (V4). The ports in San
Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and the arithmetic
mean of CPUE by year was higher also higher in this area (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-debwv})

We retained 6597 drifts for index standardization, with
2016 fishing location encountering vermilion.\\
Tables of the number of samples and positive observervations by factor can be
found in Tables (\ref{tab:tab-depth-debwv}, \ref{tab:tab-region-debwv}, and
\ref{tab:tab-year-debwv}).

\textbf{Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

A Lognormal model was
selected for the positive observation GLM by
a \(\Delta AIC\) of 313.12 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-debwv}). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-debwv}),
a main effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin
was fit for the binomial model and a main
effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin
was fit for the Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-debwv} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-debwv}). The binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the 69\% zeroes in the observed data
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-debwv}). The predicted marginal effects from
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-debwv} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-debwv}). The
final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-debwv})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-debwv}).

\subsubsection{CRFS Dockside Private Boat Index}\label{crfs-dockside-private-boat-index}}

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2018,
were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number
of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e.~effort units are angler trips),
angler-reported distance from shore, (Area.X: inside/outside of 3 nm, county, port,
interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The sample size of the
unfiltered private boat CPUE data is much larger than the crfspr CPFV data set,
with 391,279 trips statewide, 120,655 in southern California (south
of Point Conception), and 270,064 north of Point Conception.

\emph{CRFS Private Boat Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}
Records were limited to ``PR1'' sites, and only the hook-and-line gear type
(Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr}.
Since this is a dockside index lacking precise fishing location information, we
use the percent of groundfish within the catch from a trip as a proxy for retaining
trips for index standardization. Similar to the crfspr index, we partitioned the
data into areas north and south of Point Conception and applied the method
separately to each data set.

Since 2005, the recreational fishery for shelf rockfish north of Pt. Conception
has been closed from January through part of April and May.Angler reported distance
from shore had no samples in the ``outside 3 nm'' category (Area X = 2)
from 2004-2011, but was retained in the index standardization due to the relaxation
of depth restrictions beginning in 2017. We retained 59837 drifts for index standardization, with 21971 drifts encountering vermilion
(Table \ref{tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr}).

\emph{Northern California CRFS Private Boat Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-region-crfspr} and \ref{tab:tab-year-crfspr}.
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour)
a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar
in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-crfspr}).

A Lognormal model was
selected for the positive observation GLM by
a \(\Delta AIC\) of 3718.2 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \ref{fig:fig-dist-fits-crfspr}). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-crfspr}),
a main effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and AREA X
was fit for the binomial model and a main
effects model including
YEAR and WAVE and AREA X
was fit for the Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-crfspr} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-crfspr}). The binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the 63\% zeroes in the observed data
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-crfspr}). The predicted marginal effects from
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-crfspr} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-crfspr}). The
final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-crfspr})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-crfspr}).

\subsubsection{California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project Index}\label{california-collaborative-fisheries-research-project-index}}

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project, \href{https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/}{CCFRP},
is a fishery-independent
hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling
locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs along the central California coast
(Wendt and Starr 2009; Starr et al. 2015). The CCFRP survey began in 2007 and was originally
designed as a statewide program in collaboration with NMFS scientists and fishermen.
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored
four MPAs consistently. In 2017,
the program was expanded coastwide within California. The index of abundance was
developed from the four MPAs sampled consistently (Año Nuevo and Point Lobos
by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists a number 500 x 500 m cells both within and
outside each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly
selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells). CPFVs are chartered
for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for
a fishing location. During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of
30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured,
and can be linked back to a particular angler, and released (or descended to depth).
Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin
clips that provide needed biological information for nearshore species. For the index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the
fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.

\emph{CCFRP Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little
filtering was needed for the index.
Cells not consistently sampled over time were excluded as well as cells that never encountered vermilion. CCFRP samples shallower
depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality. We retained 6532 drifts for index standardization, with 2250 drifts encountering vermilion.

\emph{CCFRP Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-region-ccfrp} and \ref{tab:tab-year-ccfrp}.
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour)
a Bayesian delta-GLM model. Indices with a year and area interaction were not
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar
in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-ccfrp}). Plots of the arithmetic
mean by inside (MPA) and outside (REF) MPAs over time is in Figure \ref{fig:fig-sitecpue-ccfrp}.

A negative binomial model was fit to the drift-level data (catch with a log offset for angler
hours). Because the averaged observed CPUE inside MPAs and in the reference sites exhibited
differing trends, we explored a YEAR:SITE interaction, which was selected as the best
fit model by AIC Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-ccfrp}), The final model included
YEAR and AREA and SITE and DEPTH\_bin and YEAR:SITE and log(Effort).
The model was fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-ccfrp} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-ccfrp}). The negative binomial model generated data sets with the
proportion zeros similar to the 66\% zeroes in the observed data
(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-ccfrp}). The predicted marginal effects from the model can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dnbin-marginal-ccfrp}).

Based on work completed at the SWFSC, we estimate that the percent of rocky reef habitat from Point Conception to the California border within California state waters is 892 \(km^2\), of which approximately 23\% is in MPAs that prohibit the harvest of groundfish (pers comm. Rebecca Miller, UCSC). There is recreational fishing outside of state waters, but habitat maps are not available at the same 2-m resolution and do not allow for direct comparisons. High-resolution habitat maps are not available for the state waters south of Point Conception.

The final index was weighted, giving 20\% of the model weight to MPAs and 80\% of model
weight to the ``open'' areas within the state. The CCFRP index includes all of the
MPAs currently sampled from 2017-2020 and the core central California sampling sites
from 2007-2016. Trends among all of the MPAs sampled increased along the entire coast
from 2017-2020. The final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-ccfrp})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-ccfrp}).

To visualize the affect of weighting on the index, Figure (\ref{fig:fig-weighted-cpue-ccfrp})
shows the unweighted index and the index with 10-60\% of the weight given to MPAs versus
open areas. Each of these indices are scaled to their means to allow for direct comparison.

\subsubsection{Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey}\label{northwest-fisheries-science-center-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}}

In 2003, the NWFSC expanded the ongoing slope survey to include the continental
shelf. This survey, referred to in this document as the West Coast Groundfish
Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBT Survey or WCGBTS), is conducted annually. It uses a r
andom-grid design covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m
from late-May to early-October (Keller, Wallace, and Methot 2017). Four chartered industry vessels
are used in most years. The location of vermilion/sunset catches relative to all
survey stations in WCGBT Survey are shown in .

*\textbf{WCGBTS Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes}

Vermilion rockfish were found during the WCGBTS mainly off the coast of
California (Figure). Haul-level information collected during the
survey was extracted from the
\href{https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data}{Northwest Fisheries Science Center database}
using code within the \texttt{nwfscSurvey} package, providing information on
catches (kg),
vessel,
year,
latitude (decimal degrees), and
area swept (hectares).

Just
two
records with positive tows were located north of the California-Oregon border
and were excluded from this analysis.
ZeroMost of the positive tows were found in waters less than 200 m depth
(Table /(\textbf{ref?})\{tab:ndepth\}), and thus,
this analysis was truncated to waters with a depth of 300 m or less.

positive tows were found south of 32.45 decimal degrees,
which was used to represent the California-Mexico border.
This left,
fifty-eight
positive tows north of 34.50 decimal degrees and
one hundred twenty-three
positive tows south of 34.50 decimal degrees.
Positive encounters were just
7 and 15
percent of all tows for these two areas, respectively.

\emph{WCGBTS Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics}

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables
\ref{tab:tab-depth-wcgbts} and \ref{tab:tab-year-wcgbts}.
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour)
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.

A Gamma model was
selected for the positive observation GLM by
a \(\Delta AIC\) of 14.03
over a Lognormal model.
The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \ref{tab:tab-model-select-wcgbts}),
a main effects model including
YEAR and DEPTH bin and LAT bin
was fit for the binomial model and a main
effects model including
YEAR and PASS and DEPTH bin and LAT bin
was fit for the Gamma model.
Models were fit using the ``rstanarm'' R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model
were all reasonable (Figures \ref{fig:fig-posterior-mean-wcgbts} and
\ref{fig:fig-posterior-sd-wcgbts}). The binomial model generated data sets with the

(Figure \ref{fig:fig-propzero-wcgbts}). The predicted marginal effects from
both the binomial and Gamma models can be found in (Figures \ref{fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-wcgbts} and \ref{fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-wcgbts}). The
final index (Table \ref{tab:tab-index-wcgbts})
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:fig-cpue-wcgbts}).
