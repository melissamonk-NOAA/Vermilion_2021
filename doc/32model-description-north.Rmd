## Model Structure and Assumptions

`r Spp` `r model.area` of Point Conception (\PtC) off the coast of California
is assessed using a two-sex model with sex-specific life history parameters.  
The model assumed seven fleets with removals beginning in `r startyr`: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Commercial hook-and-line fishery
  \item Commercial trawl fishery
  \item Commercial net fishery
  \item Recreational PC retained fishery
  \item Recreational PC discard fishery
  \item Recreational PR retained fishery
  \item Recreational PR discard fishery
\end{enumerate}


```{r, echo = FALSE}
time_blocks <- data.frame(model$SelSizeAdj) %>% filter(Change.==1, Yr>1875, Yr<2021) 
```

Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for all fleets. 
The recreational PC and PR fleets applied three time blocks for selectivity:  `r startyr` - `r time_blocks$Yr[1]-1`, `r time_blocks$Yr[1]` - `r time_blocks$Yr[2]-1`, - `r time_blocks$Yr[2]` - `r endyr`. All commercial fleet selectivity was constant across model years `r startyr` - `r endyr`,

<!--The commercial selectivity applied two time blocks for selectivity: `r startyr` - 2008 and 2009 - `r endyr`. The commercial selectivity block from `r startyr` - 2008  was fixed to be asymptotic, while the selectivity block from  2009 - `r endyr`was allowed to be dome-shaped.   The recreational fleet selectivity was constant across the model years, `r startyr` - `r endyr`, and fixed to be asymptotic, although dome-shape selectivity was explored during model development. Annual recruitment deviations started in `r `min(model$recruitpars$Yr)`.

The model has the additional survey fleets:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard survey,
 \item West coast groundfish bottomfish trawl survey,
 \item Recreational PC onboard survey,
 \item Abrams thesis research survey,
 \item SWFSC groundfish ecology survey,
 \item California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project survey
\end{enumerate}

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 developed by 
Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@Methot2013]. This most recent 
version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older 
model versions. The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 
1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

### Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas





### Priors

Frog: natural mortality - Jason writing up

The prior for steepness (*h*) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an 
update for the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), 
which was endorsed by the Science and Statistical Committee in 2019.  The prior is a 
beta distribution with $mu$=0.72 and $sigma$=0.16. 

###Data Weighting
Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for 
the base model were tuned by the "Francis method," based on equation TA1.8 in Francis 
[-@Francis2011], and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing 
the residuals in the modelâ€™s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean 
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their 
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed 
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models 
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0. 

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and 
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the 
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. Additionally, weighting 
using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) 
that scales the input sample size, was explored. H

<!--However, the model did not converge when 
the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood was applied to a number of the fleets with composition 
data. Given this, and the current challenges with this method described in the Stock Synthesis 
manual [@Methot2019], the Francis weightings were applied in the pre-STAR and post-STAR 
base models. The final post-STAR base model was re-weighted twice at which point the Francis 
weights stabilized.
-->

A series of sensitivities were conducted to determine the need to estimate 
extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the survey CPUE indices, and 
described below in the Estimated Parameters section.
