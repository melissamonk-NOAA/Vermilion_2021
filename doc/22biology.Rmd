## Biological Data


### Length and Age Compositions

Differences in length compositions and length-at-age were explored 
north and south of Pt. Conception prior to any modelling. There are 
currently no available data to separate sunset and vermilion rockfishes.


Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

*North of Pt. Conception*

* Commercial sources
  + CALCOM (1978-2020)
* Recreational sources
  + Miller and Gotshall dockside survey (1959-1960)
  + CPFV samples from Commercial port samplers (1978-1979)
  + Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard observer survey (1988-1998)
  + MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)
  + CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2019)
* Fishery-independent surveys
  + CCFRP hook-and-line survey (2007-2018)
  + West Coast Groundfish Bottown Trawl Survey (2003-2019)



*South of Pt. Conception*

* Commercial sources
  + CALCOM (1978-2020)
* Recreational sources
  + Ally et al. onboard observer survey (1986-1989)
  + Collins and Crooke onboard observer survey (1975-1978)
  + MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)
  + CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2018)
* Fishery-independent surveys
  + NWFSC Hook-and-Line Survey (2004-2019)
  + West Coast Groundfish Bottown Trawl Survey (2003-2019)



The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time} and Table xxx. 
Descriptions and details of the length composition data are in the above section 
for each fleet or survey.

### Age Structures


**External Fits to Growth**


Fits to the von Bertalanffy growth curve, 
$L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in 
years, $k$ is rate of increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ 
is the asymptotic length, were explore by species and sex. 



### Ageing Precision and Bias

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 `r spp` 
otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the 
SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \@ref(fig:reader1reader2)).
Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described 
above. The same readers aged otoliths for both `r spp` stock assessmetnt models. 
Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read 
otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these 
two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts 
(CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software [@Thorson2012].
The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more 
experienced. The $\Delta AIC$ among the top three models was less than two. The 
best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard 
deviation for both readers.  
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 
selected the the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation 
(Figure \@ref(fig:oldfish)). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence 
internal using this model (Figure \@ref(fig:truereads)).  
The latter model was selected for use in the assessment. 
 

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings 
increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, 
the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.



### Maturation and Fecundity



### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT; https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel [-@Hamel2015] method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. [-@Then2018] functional regression model and is a commomly applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user. 




### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 


### Length-Weight Relationship

The length(cm)-weight(kg) relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the 
model using California biological data available from fishery-independent 
data sources. The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was $W$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at $W$=`r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ (Figure xx).



### Steepness

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` and $\sigma$=0.15) is retained.
