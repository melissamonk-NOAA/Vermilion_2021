# Introduction
Note to readers: Text in section is the same in both California vermilion rockfish assessment 
documents.


## Basic Information and Life History
Vermilion rockfish range from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to central Baja California at 
depths of 6 m to 436 m [@Love2002]. However, they are most commonly found from central Oregon
to Punta Baja, Mexico [@Hyde2009] at depths of 50 m to 150 m [@Hyde2009].  Hyde and Vetter 
[-@Hyde2009] describe vermilion rockfish as residents of shallower depths (<100 m) than 
sunset rockfish. Adult fish tend to cluster on high relief rocky outcrops [@Love2002] 
and kelp forests [@Hyde2009]. North of Point Conception, some adults are shallower, 
living in caves and cracks [@Love2002]. Vermilion rockfish have shown high site fidelity 
[@Hannah2011 (only tagged 1 vermilion); @Lea1999], and low average larval dispersal 
distance [@Hyde2009]. Lowe et al. (2009) [-@Lowe2009] suggested vermilion rockfish to 
have a lower site fidelity than previously believed, but they acknowledged that their
observations of movements to different depths may have been due to the reality of a 
shallower species and a deeper species. 
Approximate lifespan for vermilion rockfish is 60 years, with females living longer 
and growing larger than their male counterparts. 50% are mature at 5 years and about 
37 cm, with males probably maturing at shorter lengths than females [@Love2002].

Vermilion rockfish are viviparous, and release 63,000 to 2,600,000 eggs per season. 
In southern California, vermilion rockfish larvae are released between July and March. 
In central and northern California, this release occurs in September, December, and 
April-June [@Love2002].  Larval release in fall and winter is not common among other 
rockfish species. Hyde and Vetter [-@Hyde2009] suggest that low larval dispersal may 
be due to weak poleward flow of nearshore waters corresponding with peak vermilion larval release. 

Young-of-the-year vermilion rockfish settle out of the plankton during two recruitment 
periods per year, first from February to April and a second from August to October, 
and settlement has been observed in May off southern California [@Love2002]. Larvae 
measure about 4.3 mm. Both young-of-the-year vermilion and sunset rockfish are mottled 
brown with areas of black, and older juveniles turn a mottled orange or red color [@Love2012a]. 
Juvenile fish are found individually from 6 m to 36 m, living near sand and structures. 
After two months, juveniles travel deeper and live on low relief rocky outcrops and 
other structures [@Love2002].

Adult vermilion rockfish predominantly eat smaller fish, though sometimes they pursue 
euphausiids and other various macroplankton [@Phillips1964]. Love [-@Love2002] noted 
their diet to include octopus, salps, shrimps, and pelagic red crabs. 


*Population Structure and Complex Assessment Considerations*

This assessment represents the cryptic species pair vermilion rockfish 
(*Sebastes miniatus*) and sunset rockfish (*Sebastes crocotulus*).
Hyde [-@Hyde2007] found seven mirochondrial and two nuclear genes analysis suggested 
three species within the subgenus *Rosicola*. Hyde et al. 
[-@Hyde2008b] described sunset rockfish as a distinct species noting depth separation 
of the adult populations of the two species using nine microsatellite loci. 
Sunset rockfish is distributed at depths 
greater than 50 fm (100 m) and are predominantly located south of Point Conception (\PtC). 
Hyde and Budrick identified speciation using mtDNA assay and size microsatelite loci, 
respectively.  The mtDNA analyses proved to be subject to introgression and mis-specification 
of sunset rockfish from mating between the two species post-divergence.
Additional population clusters of vermilion were found north of Point Conception, but neither 
study detected population structure between Half Moon Bay, California and Brookings, 
Oregon [@Hyde2009; @Budrick2016].

Vermilion and sunset rockfishes are morphologically very similar, with the most commonly 
cited differentiating feature being color. Hyde [-@Hyde2009] noted differences in three of six morphological 
parameters examined, but none of them can readily be used for field identification.

In all historical and current recreational and commercial catches, sunset and 
vermilion rockfish are both recorded as vermilion rockfish.  Future studies, 
such as the one described below will provide data needed to compare biological 
parameters between the two species as well as habitats.

_Ongoing Population Structure Research (Provided by John Harms, NWFSC)_

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to 
genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic 
pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the Southern 
CA Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019.  Funding for this 
project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for FY 2020 through a 
proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and 
the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.  

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along 
the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed.  Some 
earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA) markers.  However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from 
the vermilion genome into the sunset genome, a portion of the sunset rockfish 
population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish 
resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals 
during the prior research project.  The current research has identified a robust 
suite of genetic markers within the nuclear genomes of the two species that 
definitively separates vermilion and sunset rockfish (including  introgressed 
sunset rockfish), canary rockfish, first generation vermilion-sunset hybrids, 
and identifies emerging patterns of intraspecific stock structure within the 
two sister species.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences 
in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships, 
and other biological characteristics will be identified.  Using previously 
collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including 
age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at 
50% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared. 
These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA 
work to  evaluate whether introgressed sunset rockfish represent a biologically
intermediate subform of the species complex.  The effort also proposes to develop 
and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two 
species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of 
co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other 
information.  The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens 
is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock
assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair 
and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community.  If 
successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors, 
may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and 
management of cryptic species complexes.  Though this project will only focus 
on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey 
field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard 
fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs 
continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely 
monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.


## Map
A map showing the scope of the two vermilion rockfish assessments and depicting boundaries 
at Point Conception (\PtC) that separates the two assessments. THe northern 
model is bounded by the California/Oregon border and the southern model is 
bounded by the U.S./ Mexico border at the south (Figure \@ref(fig:assess-area)). 
Cape Mendocino (\CapeM) is also noted as it is a management boundary for the 
minor shelf rockfish complex.


## Ecosystem Considerations

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, 
habitat factors (other than as inform relative abundance indices) or environmental 
factors into the assessment model, but a brief description of likely or potential 
ecosystem considerations are provided below. 

Vermilion/sunset rockfish are described as feeding on a wide range of both
pelagic and benthic prey items, including forage fish species such as anchovies 
and mesopelagic fishes, squid, krill and octopus, as well as sporadically abundant
pelagic organisms such as pyrosomes, salps and pelagic red crabs 
[@Phillips1964; @Love2002].  Interestingly, other rockfishes (either juvenile or 
adult stages) have not been 
documented as prey for vermilion, as they have been for other larger *Sebastes* 
species such as cowcod, bocaccio and yelloweye rockfish.  For the latter species, 
the idea of “cultivation effects,” in which adults crop down forage species that 
are potential competitors/predators of their own juveniles [@Walters2001], 
have been suggested by [@MacCall2002, @Baskett2006]. For example, Baskett et al. [-@Baskett2006] 
found that in such scenarios there could be alternative stable states in which 
either the overfished species or the smaller prey species could dominate.  While 
the sparse diet data for vermilion/sunset rockfish do not suggest such a process 
for this species complex, food habits data for vermilion/sunset are not robust, 
and the larger community processes on these rocky reef communities may also influence 
productivity and community composition regardless of the direct predation interactions. 
Pelagic and benthic juvenile vermilion and sunset rockfish are likely preyed upon by 
the same wide range of predators that prey on juveniles and adults of other rockfish 
species, including seabirds, piscivorous fishes, and marine mammals.  

As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment, 
or cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for the vermilion/sunset 
rockfish complex, with only a modest apparent relationship to spawning output.  
Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of
recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements
of California Current food webs.  Empirical estimates of recruitment from pelagic 
juvenile rockfish surveys have been used to inform incoming year class strength for 
some of these stocks, however vermilion and sunset rockfish are rarely encountered 
in these surveys.  Specifically, only 47 of nearly 300,000 total juvenile *Sebastes* 
encountered in juvenile surveys since 2001 were identified as vermilion or sunset 
rockfish [@Field2021].  Despite this, the results here suggest that at least a
reasonable fraction of recruitment variability for sunset and vermilion rockfish 
is shared with other rockfish and groundfish stocks throughout the California Current, 
many of which also had strong year classes in 1984, 1999 and 2015.  Previous studies 
have demonstrated that large-scale oceanographic drivers, such as the relative transport 
of subarctic waters (typically indicated by relative sea level) tend to relate to a 
substantial fraction of overall groundfish recruitment trends and ecosystem 
productivity [@Stachura2014, @Schroeder2019].  Although it is feasible that 
ecosystem factors, the results of pre-recruit surveys for co-occurring species, 
or the results of other groundfish assessments might ultimately be used to 
forecast recruitment for more data-limited stocks such as vermilion/sunset,
as suggested by [@Thorson2014], such approaches would require more 
development and evaluation.  Consequently, environmental factors are not 
explicitly considered in this assessment.



## Historical and Current Fishery Information
The hook-and-line fishery off California developed in the late 19th century 
[@Love2002]. The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when 
the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red 
meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; 
@Harry1961]. 

Vermilion are landed in the live-fish fishery that developed off the coast of 
California in the 1990s, but have not been a target of that fishery due to their to barotrauma.  
The fraction of the total catch 
from the live fish fleet is small and included in the commercial hook-and-line 
fleet in the California assessment models.  The STAT also learned that vermilion 
targeted for the live fish fishery, but landed 
dead due to barotrauma may still be sold.


The commercial net fishery...\
The commercial trawl fishery...

Miller et al. [-@Miller2014 described the spatial and temporal development of the 
California groundfish fishery. They analyzed a spatially-explicit database of 
landings in California dating back to 1933, finding that groundfish fishing effort 
has shifted from shallow, coastal areas to deeper depths and greater distances from 
port over time. Sampling of commercial species compositions in Southern California 
began in 1983, a time when the groundfish fleet was already fishing in deeper depths.
Both historical reconstructions used these data to represent species compositions of 
total rockfish catch during earlier periods of the fishery, and as a result may 
overestimate the percentage of cowcod in earlier fisheries that operated closer 
to port and in shallower depths. Sensitivities to the magnitude of historical catch 
reconstructions are presented as model sensitivities in the pre-STAR base model.

The Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV; aka ‘party’ and ‘charter’ boat) 
fleet began ca. 1919 in California, although recreational fishing effort for 
fishes other than Tunas, other gamefish and salmon was minimal until about 1930. T
he CPFV fleet numbered about 200 vessels in 1939 [@Croker1939, cited in Young [-@Young1969]). 
After a hiatus in most operations during WWII, the fleet increased to about 590 vessels 
by 1953, then declined to approximately 256 vessels around 1963. 

Vermilion rockfish are a targeted species in California's recreational fishery
and have always been a large fraction of the recreational fishery, xxxxfrog.
North of Point Conception, the majority of vermilion rockfish landings have been 
from ports in San Luis Obispo county.  







## Summary of Management History

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) 
in 1982, vermilion rockfish were managed through a regulatory process that included the 
California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) along 
with either the California State Legislature or the Fish and Game Commission (FGC) 
depending on the sector (recreation or commercial) and fishery. With implementation 
of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, vermilion rockfish came under the management 
authority of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), and were managed as part 
of the *Sebastes* complex. Because neither species had undergone rigorous stock assessment 
and did not compose a large fraction of the landings they were classified and 
managed as part of "Remaining Rockfish" under the larger 
heading of "Other Rockfish" (PFMC [-@PFMC2004; -@PFMC2002]).

Since the early 1980s a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to 
manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally 
for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish 
fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access 
with specific regulations designed for each component. Other regulatory actions 
for the general rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions, 
and cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial sectors - 
limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl.
Harvest guidelines are also used to regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and 
commercial sectors. 

In 2000, changes in the PFMC’s rockfish management structure resulted in the discontinued 
use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and was replaced with three species 
groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes (January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221), of 
which vermilion rockfish are included in the minor shelf rockfish group. 

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major changes also occurred in the way 
that California managed its nearshore fishery. The Marine Life Management Act 
(MLMA), which was passed in 1998 by the California Legislature and enacted in 
1999, required that the FGC adopt an FMP for nearshore finfish [@Vandenberg2014]. 

Following adoption of the Nearshore FMP and accompanying regulations by the FGC in 
fall of 2002, the FGC adopted regulations in November 2002 which established a set 
of marine reserves around the Channel Islands in southern California (which became 
effective April 2003).  The FGC also adopted a nearshore restricted access program in December 
2002 (which included the establishment of a Deeper Nearshore Permit) to be effective 
starting in the 2003 fishing year.

Also, since the enactment of the MLMA, the Council and State in a coordinated 
effort developed and adopted various management specifications to keep harvest 
within the harvest targets, including seasonal and area closures (e.g. the CCAs; 
a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, minimum 
size limits, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license 
and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal 
and area closures (e.g. the RCAs and CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to 
specific fishing), depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size 
limits to regulate the commercial fishery.

The state of California has adopted regulatory measures to manage the minor seashore 
shallow rockfish fishery 
based on the harvest guidelines set forth by the PFMC.  The commercial open access 
and limited entry fixed gear sectors have undergone 
three different spatial management changes since 2000.  Since 2005, both 
have managed the area south of \CapeM as one area. 
The open access commercial fishery is managed based on bimonthly 
allowable catches, that have ranged from 200 pounds to 1800 pounds per two months since 2000.
From 2005 to 2018, the catch limits have doubled and are now set at 1200 pounds per two 
months (for all months) with March and April remaining closed. The limited entry fixed gear 
sector has followed the same pattern as the open access sector with bi-monthly limits 
and a doubling of the catch since 2005. The limited entry trawl fleet is managed on 
monthly limits on an annual basis. Since 2011, the limit has been 300 pounds per month for 
non-IFQ species.  A history of California's commercial regulations from 2000-2018 can be 
found in [Appendix A](#appendix-a.-californias-commercial-fishery-regulations). A 10-inch 
total length minimum size limit was implemented in 1999 for both species in the commercial fleet.


**Recreational Fisheries**

In March 1984 a recreational bag limig of 10 fish went into effect in California 
within the 20 fish aggregate. Significant regulatory changes in California's 
recreational sector began with a change 
from unlimited number of hooks and lines allowed prior to 2000 to no more than 
three hooks and one line per angler in 2000.  Since 2001, the limit has been no more than 
two hooks and one line per angler.  There is no size limit in the recreational fishery 
for vermilion rockfish. 

California also began spatial management, including area closures, and depth 
restrictions for the recreational fleet in 2000.  In general, the recreational 
season north of Point Conception 
extends from April to December, and south of Point Conception from March to December. 
In the area that vermilion rockfish are most commonly landed, from Monterey to Morro Bay, the 
maximum depth open to recreational fishing has been between 30 and 40 
fathoms until 2017.  In 2017 the depth restrictions were eased by 10 fathoms, 
opening up fishing depths along the central California coast that had not been 
open consistently since 2002.  In 
both 2017 and 2018, the deepest 10 fathoms was closed prior to the prescribed 
season in December due to high by-catch rates of yelloweye rockfish, which is still 
overfished. A full history of the recreational 
regulations relating to the spatial management of the fleet can be found frog.   

Beginning on January 1, 2021 CDFW implemented a five-fish sub-bag limit for 
`vermilionvermilion rockfish rockfish that is not accounted for in this stock assessment.

**Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCA)**
In 2001, two area closures [“Cowcod Conservation Areas”](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36132&inline) were implemented to reduce fishing mortality of cowcod, originally prohibiting bottom-fishing deeper than 20 fm. Effective 2019, retention of nearshore and shelf rockfish (excluding cowcod) is allowed in depths shallower than 40 fm. The larger of the two areas (CCA West) is a 4200 square mile area west of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. A smaller area (CCA East) is about 40 miles offshore of San Diego, and covers about 100 square miles.

**Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCA)**
In 2002 the PFMC established trawl- and non-trawl area closures known as the Rockfish Conservation Areas. These closed areas are gear-specific, and have seasonally changing boundaries to help reduce fishing mortality.

**Marine Protected Areas (MPA)**

## Management Performance
The contribution of vermilion rockfish to the shelf rockfish OFLs is currently derived from 
the data-poor Depletion Corrected Average Catch model [@Dick2010].  A 2005 
assessment was not accepted for management and a 2013 data-moderate assessment 
was not reviewed by the STAR panel due to insufficient time.


Total mortality for vermilion rockfish was obtaid from the Groundfish Expanded Mortality 
Multiyear [GEMM](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/api/v1/source/observer.gemm_fact/selection.xlsx) 
report [@Somers2020]. The coastwide management of the shelf rockfish complex is split at Cape 
Mendocino (\CapeM).  Therefore, the  northern California vermilion rockfish 
model contains a portion of the management area from Cape Mendocino (\CapeM) 
to the California-Oregon border (\CAOR).  The southern California vermilion rockfish contains the 
area within the southern management area (south of \CapeM) south of Point Conception (\PtC).

The total mortality of the nearshore rockfish 
south complex has been above the OFL in all years (2011-2019) north of \CapeM, and 
above the OFL south of \CapeM from 2015-2019. Total mortality 
estimates from the NMFS NWFSC are not yet available for 2020 (Table \@ref(tab:management). Vermilion rockfish total 
mortality was on average 59% (range 55%-66%) of the total shelf rockfish south 
of \CapeM total mortality from 2011-2016.  Vermilion rockfish decreased from 21% to 4% of 
the total contribution to the shelf rockfish complex north of \CapeM from 2011-2019 with a 
noticeable decline from 16% to 6% from 2016 to 2017.



## Foreign Fisheries

*Sebastes* spp. are not in the Fisheries National Chart (FNC, database containing 
species status) maintained by the Mexican Government, i.e., they are not commercially 
harvested in the northwest Mexican Pacific Ocean (E.M. Boj&oacute;rquez, Centro de 
Investigaciones Biol&oacute;gicas del Noroeste, S.C., perconal communication).  Dr. 
Boj&oacute;rquez also reached out to colleagues at the 
[Fisheries National Institute](https://www.gob.mx/inapesca) who reported that rockfish 
are occasionally caught in the sport fishery in the Ensenada City.

# Data

The STAT presented proposed analyses and data sources for the 2021 vermilion rockfish 
assessment during the PFMC Pre-Assessment Workshop for 2021 Vermilion and 
Lingcod Stock Assessments, hosted virtually on March 29, 2021. Topics addressed 
included progress on research priorities, data sources and types, stock structure, 
fleet structure, key model parameters (e.g. natural mortality), and potential 
challenges. Descriptions of each data source included in the model 
(Figure \@ref(fig:data-plot)) and sources that were explored, but not included
are included within this section.

## Fishery-Dependent Data

A complete summary of estimated vermilion rockfish removals by each fleet in the 
commercial and recreational fleets modeled in this assessment are provided in Table 
\@ref(tab:landings).  The data sources for landings varied by each fleet and a summary 
of each data source and the time period for which it was used is in Table \@ref(catch-source).
Of note is that the commercial landings are in metric tons (mt) and the recreational landings 
are in numbers of fish (thousands of fish). Data and 
methods used to derive these estimates are described in this section.

## Commercial


### Commercial Landings and Discards

*Commercial Landings Prior to 1916*

For landings estimates prior to 1916, we based our reconstruction on the total 
rockfish catches reported in a summary of early California fisheries landings by 
Sette and Fielder [-@Sette1928] for the years 1888, 1892, 1895, 1899, 1904, 1908 
and 1915.  No rockfish were reported for 1888, thus we assumed no catches for that
year and interpolated the catches between 0 and the 1892 catches (total of 834 
tons) reported.  Similarly, catches between the reported years were interpolated 
assuming a straight linear trend between the years reported.  We used a 
ratio-estimator derived from the catch reconstruction fraction of vermilion 
rockfish in total rockfish landings for the 1916 to 1919 period (the ratio for
a comparable five year period was nearly identical).  We apportioned the catches 
north and south of Point Conception based on ratio estimators that used the same 
assumptions used to apportion catches in the reconstruction time period (1916-1968).
The catch reconstruction estimates indicated that vermilion made up slightly under 
1% of the total rockfish catches during the early (1916-1919) time period, although 
the estimates indicate a slightly larger fraction (1.5%) of total catches south of 
Conception relative to the fraction of total catches to the north (0.9%).  However, 
it is likely that the reconstruction is overestimating the fraction of smaller and/or 
more deeply distributed species relative to larger, shallower species as the 
reconstruction is based on the species composition data collected from market 
category samples in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The fishery has been shown
to have progressed over time from a shallower, more nearshore distribution of 
effort to one in which deeper and more offshore waters were targeted [@Miller2014]. 
The notion that vermilion catches may have been greater is also consistent with 
the recognition by Roedel [-@Roedel1948] that during the 1930s and 1940s vermilion 
were “One of the more important commercial species, it is one of three leading 
species in Southern California." However, by the time of that report, vermilion 
represented five to eight percent of the southern California catch (based on 
Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010]), much more than at the beginning of the time 
series.  Future efforts to improve historical catch reconstructions by accounting 
for the shift in effort over time to deeper waters should continue to be flagged 
as a research need. 


*Commercial Landings, 1916-2020*

For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction 
database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010b]. 
Landings in this database are divided into trawl, ‘non-trawl’, and ‘unknown’ gear 
categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] were 
assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al. includes Santa 
Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports in San 
Luis Obispo County (north of Point Conception). To allocate catches from Region 
6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used 
by Dick et al. [-@Dick2007] for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, 
port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were 
used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of
Point Conception (Table XXX). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported 
at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition 
catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the 
absence of port-specific species composition data. 

Years with no data were imputed 
using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations 
(Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from 
known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were 
allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, 
total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by 
Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010b], and assigned to the assessment areas north and 
south of Point Conception, and either trawl or ‘non-trawl’ gear types. To 
approximate California landings from 1900 to 1915, we used a linear interpolation 
starting from zero metric tons in 1899 to the amount of ‘non-trawl’ catch, by 
area, in 1916 (Table frog-EJ?). Since hook and line gears catch the majority of 
commercially-caught vermilion rockfish, we assigned estimated catch in the 
‘non-trawl’ category to the hook and line fleet in the assessment model.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) 
incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into 
the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (“fish tickets”), 
including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish 
landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition 
samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 
‘ratio estimator’ landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the 
CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available
landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes. Since commercial 
port sampling south of Point Conception started later, ratio estimates were used 
in some southern California port complexes through 1983. See Appendix A of Dick 
et al. [-@Dick2007] and Pearson et al. [-@Pearson2008]; pp. 8 and 15-16] for 
further details.

*Commercial length and age composition data*

Biological data from the commercial fisheries that landed vermilion rockfish were extracted 
from CALCOM on frog. The CALCOM length composition data were catch-weighted 
to "expanded" length the raw length composition data. The length composition and mean 
size by year are available in Figures \@ref(fig:len-data-COM-HKL) and \@ref(fig:mean-com-len-data-COM-HKL) 
for the commercial hook-and-line fleet, 
\@ref(fig:len-data-COM-TWL) and \@ref(fig:mean-com-len-data-COM-TWL) for the commercial trawl fleet, 
and \@ref(fig:len-data-COM_NET and \@ref(fig:mean-com-len-data-COM-NET) for the commercial net fleet.
Input sample sizes for commercial length composition varied depending on the 
available data source and are in Table \@ref(tab:length-sample-size). 


Commercial discard length compositions from \gls{wcgop} were provided on 
17 Nov 2020 by Andi Stephens (NWFSC).  Only 224 vermilion were measured statewide from 
2004-2018.  The sparse discard length composition data were not considered for use in the 
model as discarded catch is a small fraction of the overall commercial landings.

Otoliths collected from commercial fisheries north of Point Conception were provided by 
the Pacific States Fisheries Commision and aged, but not used in the assessment due 
to low annual sample sizes.


### Recreational Landings and Discard


*Recreational Landings, 1928-1980*

[paragraph on Ralston et al. rec reconstruction pending -- use mode-specific values from JF]
[also include paragraph about sensitivities to discard -- not included in Ralston reconstruction]

*Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003*

MRFSS estimates of California recreational landings from 1980-1989 and 1993-2003  
were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network 
([RecFIN](https://www.recfin.org/)). The MRFSS survey design included stratification by 
species (sunset rockfish were not recognized at the time), subregion (northern 
and southern California), 2-month ‘wave’, water area (e.g. within or beyond 
three miles from shore), and fishing mode (party/charter (PC) and private/rental (PR) boats,
plus various shore modes).  The PC mode includes the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel 
fleet (CPFV).

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) missing estimates of catch 
in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, 2) a change in the 
spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, and 3) a hiatus in 
sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode 
north of Point Conception. The STAT attempted to address each of these issues, 
as described below. CRFS estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS 
analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are 
included in the MRFSS catch estimate tables.

The MRFSS estimated catch in numbers of fish and converted these to catch in 
weight using estimates of average fish weight [kg] from the same stratum. When 
a stratum contained an estimate of catch in numbers but was missing an average 
weight, the estimate of catch in weight for that stratum was omitted (or sometimes 
assigned a zero value) in the database. To correct these errors, the STAT first 
identified strata with positive catch in numbers but missing or zero values for 
catch in weight. Catch in weight for these strata was then estimated by imputing 
a value of average weight based on the mean of the reported average weights in 
the same year and subregion. These factors had a greater influence on average 
weight than boat mode (Figure  frog EJ). The effect of this correction was relatively 
minor for vermilion rockfish overall (~1% increase in total catch by weight, 
1980-2004). However, 70% of missing catch in weight occurred over the years 
2001-2004, with differences in individual year/mode/subregion combinations sometimes exceeding 10-20%.

MRFSS catch estimates for California were spatially stratified into two subregions, 
“Southern California” (subregion 1) and “Northern California” (subregion 2). 
During the 1990-1992 statewide hiatus in sampling, the definitions of these two 
subregions changed. Specifically, San Luis Obispo (SLO) County was included in 
the southern region prior to the hiatus (i.e. 1980-1989) [@Witzig1992; @Karpov1995], 
but moved to the northern subregion starting in 1993. In order to create a 
definition of spatial strata that is consistent and comparable over time, and 
one that is consistently divided near Point Conception, the STAT examined catch 
estimates from a separate study [@Albin1993] that used a finer spatial 
resolution in the northern subregion (including SLO County). Over the period 
1981-1986, the amount of vermilion rockfish landed in SLO County was found to 
be roughly equal to the amount of vermilion rockfish landed in all California 
counties north of SLO County (Table frog EJ). Therefore, to approximate catches north
and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the ‘southern’ 
subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by an amount 
equal to the northern subregion catch during the same period, and doubled the 
northern subregion catch. On average, this ‘moves’ the estimated SLO County 
catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating 
a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series.


As noted above, MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues. 
The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the PC boat 
mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County.  To 
produce catch estimates for the missing subregion/mode/year combinations, we 
used linear interpolation. Shore modes were a minor component of the vermilion 
catch and therefore combined with catches from the private (PR) boat mode into 
a single fleet. Specifically, catches were aggregated by subregion (adjusted as 
described above), year, and mode, and endpoints for the interpolations were 
defined as 2-year averages to reduce the effects of interannual variability 
in catch on interpolated estimates.

MRFSS estimates of catch and discard after adjustment for missing average weights,
changes in subregion definition, and sampling gaps are shown in Table (@ref(tab:landings).

*California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2020*

Estimates of recreational landings and discard since 2004 have been produced by 
the CRFS. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, with higher 
sampling rates and finer spatial and temporal resolution.
Mortality estimates for the period 2005-2018 were queried from [RecFIN](www.recfin.org). 
Reported estimates are for southern California, all modes, and filtered to exclude fish 
caught in Mexican waters. Total recreational mortality estimates provided to RecFIN are 
also adjusted using species- and depth-specific discard mortality rates.


<!--
*Discard mortality rates*

The recreational discard mortality rates for vermilion that were endorsed by the 
SSC and adopted by the 
PFMC in March 2017 are 20% for 0-10 fm, 34% for 10-20 fm, 50% for 20-30 fm, and 
100% for greater than 30 fm.

Nearshore rates (jig and pole): 0-10 fm 20%; 10-20 fm 34%, >20 fm 100%

*Recreational age composition data*

There are no recreational age composition data available for vermilion rockfish from state sampling 
programs.
Otoliths are available from collaborative with Cal Poly to investigate 
the precision of back-calculating whole fish lenght from filleted fish in the CPFV fleet. 
These otoliths were not aged for this assessment. 

*Recreational indices of abundance*

There are several available datasets 


## Fishery-Independent data



### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@Keller2017].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to 
a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes'
of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late 
May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel 
differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a 
relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large 
set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The WCGBTS encounters a   .... Vermilion rockfish are strongly associated with rocky 
habitat, e.g., untrawlable habitat, but can be found over soft bottom, especially as 
juveniles.  xxx  Vermilion rockfish were rare north of San Francisco Bay, which is 
consistant with the southern distribution of the species.
 
**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* The assessment north of Point Conception includes xx ages 
from the survey and the assessment south of Point Conception includes xx ages from the survey. 
There were an additional xx fish lengths in the north and xx in the south.
Additional lengths of fish without ages xxx.
The length composition and mean lengths of vermilion from the WCGBT survey are in 
Figures \@ref(fig:len-data-REC-PC-NWFSC-TWL) and \@ref(fig:mean-com-len-data-NWFSC-TWL).

*Maturity samples.* Maturity samples were analyzed by by Melissa Head, NWFSC and a 
description of the results is in the section on biological data.

*Index of abundance.* The index was considered, but not used in the pre-STAR base model. Sample 
sizes of vermilion rockfish were low. A VAST model was attempted and did not converge 
for either the northern or southern California data and a VAST model that modeled the 
entire California coast assumed the same trends  in both areas.  The STAT also developed 
a delta-glm model for each area (north and south of Point Conception). Full details on the 
sample sizes of the observed data, the delta-generalized linear model explored and 
diagnostics, are in the appendix.

### J. Abrams thesis data

For his master's thesis work at Humboldt State University, Jeff Abrams conducted fishery-independent
hook-and-line surveys in 2010 and 2011 off the coast of California's North Coast. Sites were randomly sampled from 
areas of known rocky habitat within six depth by distance-from-port strata out of three ports:
Crescent City Harbor, Trinidad Bay and Noyo River Harbor.  The otoliths collected as part of this 
study are valuable for nearshore groundfish stock assessments that are lacking biological samples, 
especially from the North Coast. This collection resides at the SWFSC Santa Cruz lab. 

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* The available length composition and mean size are in Figures 
\@ref(fig:len-data-REC-ABRAMS-RESEARCH) and \@ref(fig:mean-com-len-data-ABRAMS-RESEARCH). 


### NWFSC Hook and Line Survey

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf 
rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations in the Southern California 
Bight. Key species of rockfish 
targeted by the survey are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), 
greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and 
*S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have 
been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously 
deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum 
of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the 
angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at 
each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers 
x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site 
selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@Harms2008].

### California Department of Fish and Wildlife CPFV Survey

The CDFW conducted a fishery-independent survey in the Southern California Bight 
from 1976-1989 aboard chartered CPFVs. This survey is also referred to as the 
"green binder" survey, as green binders were discovered containing data from these surveys. 
The SWFSC keypunched the available data and also houses the otolith collection from this study.

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.*
A total of xx vermilion otoliths were available for ageing, xx of which were matched to available 
data and contained information on sex.  An additional xx lengths were also included.
The available length composition and mean lengths are in Figures

### California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project

Since 2007, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project (CCFRP)
has monitored several areas in California to 
evaluate the performance of \Gls{mpa}s and understand nearshore fish populations
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015]. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four 
\Gls{mpa}s in central California
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas)
to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \Gls{cpfv}s guided by one of 
the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location:
Humboldt State University;
Bodega Marine Laboratories;
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories;
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo;
University of California, Santa Barbara; and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within 
randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \Gls{mpa}s.
Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth;
since then, some have been retained for biological collections including otoliths and fin clips.

**Available Data**

*Age and Length Data.* A total of 48 otoliths were available, but not used due to low 
annual sample sizes. Length data from te CCFRP program 
are included with length compositions and mean lengths in Figures
\@ref(fig:len_data_REC-CCFRP) and \@ref(fig:mean-com-len-data-CCFRP) .

*Index of Abundance*
The index of abundance in the pre-STAR base model is a weighted index, assuming that 
20% of the available habitat within California state waters (0-3 nm) is within MPAs. 
The SWFSC has worked extensively on quantifying rocky habitat from high resolution
bahtymetric data collected as part of the Seafloor Mapping Program.  The quantification 
of habitat has been used in a number of stock assessments to weight indices of abundance 
since 2013.  This is the first time the habitat data are utilized to weight an inside/outside 
MPA effet within an index.  Full details on the observed data, model selection and modeling 
methods can be found in the Appendix.


## Data sources considered, but not used



Vermilion rockfish are not well sampled by the following studies we considered as possible 
data sources.

*NWFSC Triennial Survey*

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey 
continued until 2004 [@Dark1994].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across 
the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower 
than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the 
data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 
36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the 
southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and 
surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} 
conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.


*Alaska Fisheries Science Center Slope Survey* 

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the 
R/V _Miller Freeman_.
Partial survey coverage of the US West Coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 
and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the 
years 1997 and 1999-2001.
Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included 
in assessments.


*Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans*

The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans, 
[PISCO-UCSC](http://www.piscoweb.org/kelp-forest-study), conducts a number of surveys 
to monitor the kelp forests, one of which is a kelp forest fish survey. PISCO
has monitored fish population in the 0-20 m depth range as part of the 
Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) since 1998.  Paired sites inside and outside MPAs 
are surveyed to monitor the long-term dynamics of the kelp forest ecosystem and provide 
insight into the effect of MPAs on kelp forest species. PISCO conducts the fish 
surveys from late July through September. At each site, benthic, midwater, and canopy 
scuba transects are conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 20 m depth.  All divers are trained 
in species identification.  Along each 30 m transect, divers enumerate all identifiable 
non-cryptic fish, and measure total length to the nearest centimeter.  PISCO surveys 
are conducted by the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in central California and 
through the University of California Santa Barbara in southern California. 

*California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations* 

The \Gls{calcofi} surveys began in 1951 and conducts quarterly cruises off southern & 
central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data on 
station and underway. Ichthyoplankon sampling with a paired bongo started in 1978. 
Data on larval abundance from the CalCOFI Ichthyoplankton survey have been used in 
stock assessments of several species, including bocaccio, cowcod and shortbelly 
rockfish.  Although the long-term dataset is limited to a small subset of species 
for which morphological identification of larvae has been possible, recent research 
has been successful at identifying a broader range of species based on genetic 
identification of larvae [@Thompson2016]. 
Vermilion rockfish cannot be identified morphologically in the ichthyoplankton 
samples. Of over 20,000 larvae identified in the 1998-2013 time period, only nine 
were vermilion rockfish, encountered in only about 1% of the hauls. Consequently, 
the data are insufficient at this time to use to inform relative abundance, although Thompson et al. 
[-@Thompson2017] do provide several relative abundance time series for other taxa, and 
future efforts may lead to better taxonomic resolution of historical or future collections.

*Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Survey*

Since 1983, the SWFSC has conducted an annual midwater trawl survey for pelagic 
juvenile rockfish and other groundfish in the Central California region of the 
California Current ([-@Ralston2013] and references therein).  Due to concerns 
about mesoscale abundance patterns and a need for greater spatial representation 
in the data, including some apparent strong differences in spatial distribution 
patterns in the early 2000s [@Hastie2007; @Ralston2013], this survey was expanded 
to a broader spatial scale in the 2001-2004 period, and since 2004 most years have 
coastwide data from a combination of SWFSC, NWFSC and Cooperative Research surveys 
(see Field et al. [-@Field2021] for more complete details regarding coastwide 
pre-recruit data, and Sakmua et al. [-@Sakuma2016] and Friedman et al. [-@Friedman2018] 
for additional details and 
alternative applications of survey data). 

Vermilion frog..


*California Collaborative Research Project*

In 2017 the California Collaborative Research Project (CCFRP) expanded state-wide 
and samples four MPAs and associated references sites in southern California.  
Vermilion rockfish have been encountered at two of the MPAs (Carrington Point off 
Santa Rosa Island and South La Jolla) and observed in 27% of all drifts at these 
two locations. The STAT determined that the was too constrained spatially and 
temportally to be considered 
for an index of abundance. There are currently 262 lengths of vermilion available.
With additional years of data, this data set can be considered for inclusion in a 
future vermilion assessment.

### Ageing Precision and Bias
Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish 
otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the 
SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \@ref(fig:reader1reader2)).
Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described 
above. The same readers aged otoliths for both vermilion rockfish stock assessmetnt models. 
Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read 
otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these 
two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts 
(CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software [@Thorson2012].
The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more 
experienced. The $\Delta AIC$ among the top three models was less than two. The 
best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard 
deviation for both readers.  
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 
selected the the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation 
(Figure \@ref(fig:oldfish)). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95% confidence 
internal using this model (Figure \@ref(fig:truereads)).The latter model was selected 
for use in the assessment and the distribution of true age and observed 
age is in Figure \@ref(fig:ageerror). 

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings 
increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, 
the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.



### Maturity
For the current assessment, Melissa Head (NWFSC, pers. comm.) determined maturity 
for frog female vermilion rockfish caught by recent fishery-independent surveys. Two types 
of maturity determinations were provided, ‘biological maturity’ and ‘functional 
maturity.’ The former category includes “juveniles exhibiting dummy runs (early 
vitellogenesis or yolk granules present in a small proportion of oocytes, some 
in early stages of cellular decay) and skip spawners (adults foregoing spawning 
in a given year)” (M. Head, pers. comm.), while the latter excludes such cases. 
Separate logistic regressions were fit to each type of maturity determination as 
a function of fork length (Figure frog), estimating LMAT at frog cm (biological 
maturity) and frog cm (functional maturity), with slopes of frog and frog, 
respectively.  The samples available from areas 
north of Pt. Conception were smaller fish and did not allow for estimates of separate 
maturity curves.  Both California vermilion assessments assumed the same maturity 
ogive (Figure \@ref(fig:maturity)). 



### Fecundity

Fecundity by female weight (kg) is in Figure \@ref(fig:fecundity).
Spawning output at age is in Figure \@ref(fig:spawningoutpuage).


### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical 
relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool 
[NMT](https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool), a Shiny-based 
graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural 
mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, 
and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently 
provides 19 options, including the Hamel [-@Hamel2015] method, which is a corrected 
form of the Then et al. [-@Then2018] functional regression model and is a commomly 
applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction 
of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user. 

We assumed the age of 54 years to represent the practical longevity (i.e., 90% of 
the commonly seen maximum age of 60) for both females and males, though the absolute 
oldest age in Oregon was >60 years. In the larger biomass, higher sampled area of 
California, ages 80+ were even encountered. Empirical $M$ estimators using the von 
Bertalanffy growth parameters were also considered, but they produced unreasonably 
high estimates (2-3 times higher than the longevity estimates). This is likely 
explained by the fact that while vermilion rockfish have protracted longevity at $L_{\infty}$. 
Additionally, the FishLife [@Thorson2017] estimate was included, though, given 
the source of FishLife data is FishBase, there is a good chance the estimates of 
$M$ are also from methods using longevity, though the actual source of longevity 
in FishLife was unknown. 
Both California vermilion assessments used the Hamel prior [-@Hamel2015], which 
is defined as a lognormal with mean $ln\frac{5.4}{A_{max}}$  and SE = 0.4384343.
Using a maximum age of 54 the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.1, which 
is used as a prior on $M$ in the assessment model. We also explore sensitivity to 
these assumptions of natural mortality through likelihood profiling.


### Sex Ratio
No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 


### Weight-Length Relationship
The weight(kg)-length(cm) relationship for vermilion rockfish was estimated external the 
model using California biological data available from fishery-independent 
data sources including the NWFSC hook-and-line survey and the WCGBTS. The estimated 
weight-length was assumed the same for males and females: 
$W$=1.744e-05$L$^3^ 
(Figure \@ref(fig:weightlength)).

# Assessment Model

## History of Modeling Approaches

Vermilion was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using 
Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) [@Dick2010]. Average catch 
2008-2009 was 136.3 mt, and the median OFL in 2010 was 314.3 mt with a 28% 
probability that recent catch exceeded the 2010 [@Dick2010].

A 2005 assessment was not accepted for management. 
From the September 2005 [Briefing Book](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2005/09/f-groundfish-management-september-2005.pdf/): 
"The SSC considers the assessment to be best available science, but at this  stage does not 
endorse the results as being suitable for setting OYs." A 2013 data moderate 
assessment was prepared, but not reviewed. From Pacific Coast Groundfish Stock 
Assessment Review (STAR) Panel Report For Data-Moderate Assessments (2013): 
"There was insufficient time during the review to evaluate all the assessments 
originally requested by the Council. Assessments for vermilion/sunset rockfishes 
(*Sebastes miniatus* and *Sebastes crocotulus*) and yellowtail rockfish 
(south of \CapeM) were not presented by the Stock Assessment Team (STAT)."


### Most Recent STAR Panel and SSC Recommendations 

The 2005 STAR panel report compiled recommendations specific to vermilion, and also 
generic rockfish recommendations The generic rockfish recommendation are not 
presented here.

**Vermilion rockfish recommendations**

Investigation into the species composition of nominal vermilion rockfish is needed.
It is not clear that separate assessments for the northern and southern areas are warranted
for vermilion rockfish. Although there were differences in the estimated magnitude and
timing of recruitment events, the estimated stock trends were similar in both areas.
Pooling of data from northern and southern areas may permit a more robust assessment
model to be obtained.

*2021 STAT response.* Since the 2005 assessment, vermilion rockfish were speciated 
to vermilion and sunset rockfishes [@Hyde2009].  Sunset rockfish are more common south of 
Pt. Conception (\PtC) and historical catches and length distributions between 
the two areas are different. The STAT discussed this at the Pre-Assessment workshop 
and all participants agreed that modeling the areas separately was an appropriate 
decision.


**General rockfish Recommendations**

- The historical catch is an important input into any stock assessment. 
Although efforts have been made to construct catch time series for California rockfish, 
a more sustained effort is needed to do this for all rockfish species. It should not be 
left to individual analysts to do this for a species as stock assessments arise. It 
should be done by a specialist team for all species simultaneously, so that consistent 
times series can beestablished.

- Management changes affect fisher behaviour and alter the correct interpretation of CPUE
time series. As for catch histories, it is important that a specialist team consider and
document all management changes and how they may have impacted on catch rates for
all species. Again, this should not be left to individual assessment authors as the issues
are generic and patterns might not be obvious without a multi-species perspective.

- Improved documentation of input data and output for GLM analyses of CPFV and
RecFIN CPUE data is recommended. In general, GLM analyses should provide analysis
of deviance tables, estimated coefficients, and their standard errors to document these
calculations. Information on amount of RecFIN records filtered by species association
also needs to be presented to show the effect of the species association analysis. 
Although this method is an objective approach to filtering records, it is unknown 
how well works in practice to reduce the potential biases of CPUE data. A paper describing a
comprehensive application of GLM methods to CPFV and RecFIN CPUE data on
California rockfish would be a important contribution to the assessment process and the
primary literature.

- Many rockfish assessments use CPUE data from the CPFV fishery as an index of
population abundance. The CPFV fishery is focused primarily on marketing a successful
“fishing experience” that is related to the desirability of the species caught, quantity,
body size, and fighting characteristics. The default assumption of proportionality
between CPUE and abundance has not been evaluated for a fishery with these
characteristics. Simulation modeling of fleet dynamics in a multi-species context is one
possible way to address these issues.

- A more complete understanding of the multi-species aspects of rockfish population
dynamics is needed. Although some rockfish stocks have declined in recent decades
under heavy fishing pressure and environmental change, other rockfish species have
apparently increased. Are these species adapted to different environmental conditions, or
are these increases due to the indirect effects of reduced competition and/or predation?


Conducting additional assessments of the many relatively uncommon rockfish in
California is a difficult but worthwhile objective. To facilitate this process, 
the Panel has a number suggestions:

1. Keep the models simple.  
2. Make reasonable assumptions based on life history and better studied species for
parameters that cannot be reliably estimated, such as natural mortality, stock-recruit
steepness, selectivity.  
3. Think meta-analytically. For example, similar species that are often caught together
are likely to have experienced similar fishing mortality rates and trends. There are also
more rigorous methods for sharing information between related stocks that could be
considered.  
4. Make the most of CPUE data:  
    + For several assessments, indices from GLM analyses of site-specific CPFV data
apparently tracked population trends better than indices from RecFIN data, even
when a subset of records had been selected using the Stevens and MacCall (2004)
procedure. Greater priority should be given to collecting site-specific CPUE data.
Given the ubiquity of GPS systems and hand-held data recorders, obstacles to
collecting site-specific information from fisheries are now logistic rather than
technological.  
    + Location information for the historical groundfish catch data of all species is
currently available, in hard copy form only, from the California Department of
Fish and Game. Putting this information into electronic format would greatly
improve the ability to assign catches of all species to specific stocks on a trip-bytrip basis.  
5. Do not put too much trust in model results. Models are no better that their input data
and assumptions, and for many rockfish species, the data are sparse and potentially
misleading.  




### Response to STAR Panel Requests (not required in draft)



## Model Specificiations


Vermilion rockfish NCA of Point Conception (\PtC) off the coast of California
is assessed using a two-sex model with sex-specific life history parameters.  
The model assumed seven fleets with removals beginning in 1875: 

*Commercial*: There are three commercial fleets; hook-and-line, trawl, and net. 
All of the commercial fleets represented landed dead catch and assumed dead discards.

*Recreational*: There are four recreational fleets.  Each of the PC and PR modes have 
separte fleets for retained and discarded catch.  This decision was driven by the 
length compositions between retained 
and discarded fish (with discarded fish on average smaller than retained fish).

*Fishery-Dependent Surveys*:  There are four fishery-dependent survey fleets, all north 
of Point Conception.  There is one for MRFRSS CPFV dockside survey, one for the CDFW/Cal Poly 
onboard observer survey, one for teh CRFS PR1 dockside survey, 
and one from the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard observer survey.

*Reserach*: There are three research fleets; one for Abrams conditional-length-at-age data, 
one for the NWFSC WCGBT survey data and one for the SWFSC groundfish ecology survey data.


###Additional Specifications



Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for all fleets. 
The recreational PC and PR fleets applied three time blocks for selectivity:  1875 - 2001, 2002 - 2016, - 2017 - 2020. All commercial fleet selectivity was constant across model years 1875 - 2020,

<!--The commercial selectivity applied two time blocks for selectivity: 1875 - 2008 and 2009 - 2020. The commercial selectivity block from 1875 - 2008  was fixed to be asymptotic, while the selectivity block from  2009 - 2020was allowed to be dome-shaped.   The recreational fleet selectivity was constant across the model years, 1875 - 2020, and fixed to be asymptotic, although dome-shape selectivity was explored during model development. Annual recruitment deviations started in `r `min(model$recruitpars$Yr)`.

-->

The length composition data for some years and fleets was small, and may not be 
representative of the total catch.  Length composition data were removed from the 
model if fewer than 20 fish were measured in a given 
year and fleet. Initial input sample sizes were also capped at x00 for each set of length composition 
data.

The time-series of landings begins in 1916 for the commercial fleet and in 1928 for 
the recreational fleet.  This captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is 
assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.

The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-70, where age 70 is the ‘plus-group.’ 
There are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 28. 
The population length bins and the length composition length bins are set at 2-cm bins from 
fish 10-70 cm fork length.


### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16.00 developed by 
Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@Methot2013]. This most recent 
version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older 
model versions. The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 
1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

Electronic SS model files including the data, control, starter, and forecast files can be 
found on the 
[PFMC's website](https://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/).


### Model Parameters


### Priors

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.15) is retained.  


### Data Weighting
Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for 
the base model were tuned by the "Francis method," based on equation TA1.8 in Francis 
[-@Francis2011], and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing 
the residuals in the model’s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean 
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their 
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed 
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models 
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0. 

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and 
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the 
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. Additionally, weighting 
using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) 
that scales the input sample size, was explored. However, all estimates of the ratio of 
$\theta/(1+\theta)$ were greater than 0.99, which indicates the models is trying to tune 
the sample size as high as possible.  Given this result, the STAT chose not to further explore 
the Dirichlet-Multinomial data weighting. As a note, there is a bug in SS Version 3.30.16.00 that 
prevents the number of estimated weights from being larger than the number of fleets.  This was 
fixed in SS Version 3.30.16.01 and this version was only used for exploration of the Dirichlet-Multinomial 
data weighting.

A series of sensitivities were conducted during model development to determine the need to estimate 
extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the survey CPUE indices, and 
described below in the Estimated Parameters section. 




### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices


### Evaluation of Model Parameters




### Convergence

Model convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed 
values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better 
minimum. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal 
distribution logistically transformed into each parameter’s range [@Methot2019]. This 
was repeated 300 times and the minimum was reached in 67% of the runs  (Figure \@ref(fig:jitter)).
The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001,
when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting 
the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability.  We did sensitivity runs for 
convergence by changing the phases for key estimated parameters; neither the total 
log-likelihood nor the parameter estimates changed.



## Pre-STAR Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}.

### Parameter Estimates



The base model has a total of 104 estimated parameters
(Figure \@ref(tab:params)) that can be grouped into the following
categories and are described in more detail in the following sections:

Biological parameters  
- 2 natural mortality parameters (female and male $M$)
- 10 growth parameters, where females and males each had
- 3 Schnute growth parameters (length at age frog, length at age frog, and $k$)
- 2 parameters controlling variability in growth, the CV in length at age 0.5
  and the CV in length at age 14 with a linear ramp in length-at-age

Stock-recruit parameters  
- 160 recruitment parameters  
- $log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment  
- 158 recruitment deviations parameters covering the range  
  1875-2032, with 
  1970-2020
  representing the "main" period modeled as a zero-centered deviation vector  
  
Index parameters  
- 1 extra standard deviation parameters
for indices  

Selectivity parameters  
- 39 selectivity parameters, of which
16 represented changes over time  

### Fixed parameters

- $h$ controlling the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship
- $M$ for males

### Fits to the Data

Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below. 
The full r4ss plotting output is available in the supplementary material.

### Population Trajectory


Figure \@ref(fig:bh-curve)
Figure \@ref(fig:bh-resids)

### Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model, 2020. 
Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) was 
140.88 mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished level ($SB_{40\%}$) was 497.31 
million eggs. 

The predicted spawning output from the base model shows frogs (Figure \@ref(fig:ssb)).  The spawning output then frogs.

The 2020. spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40% of unfished levels (Figure \@ref(fig:depl)). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, was above the management target frogs (Figure \@ref(fig:1-spr)). The relative fishing intensity has been frogs (Figure \@ref(fig:phase)).

Table \ref{tab:ref-pts} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figures \@ref(fig:yield2) and \@ref(fig:yield3) show the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

### Sensitivity to Assumptions, Data and, Weighting





### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and over natural mortality 
values separately with the post-STAR base. These likelihood profiles were conducted by 
fixing the parameter 
at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter 
value (Tables frog).

# Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

**This section will be completed after the STAR panel**
<!--
Projections of OFL (mt), ABC (mt), age 10+ biomass (mt), spawning output (billions of eggs), and depletion (% of unfished spawning output) are shown for the default harvest control rule in Table 62. Catch estimates for 2021 and 2022 are based on GMT recommendations (M. Mandrup, CDFW; pers. comm.), with frog mt for commercial and frog mt for recreational fleets. Projections assume a constant allocation among fleets equal to the recommended catch for 2021 and 2022 (frog% commercial, frog% commercial).
-->

# Regional Management Considerations
The state of California implements regional management for the recreational fleet in 
the form of five regions, referred to as management areas with differing depth and season 
restrictions. Until there is additional information on the distribution, life history 
differences between sunset and vermilion rockfishes, the current regional management 
framework is appropriate. The results from the ongoing SK grant exploring vermilion and sunset rockfish genetics will provide a more appropriate. HOwever, given the difficulty of differentiating 
the cryptic species pair without genetic identification, it is not feasible to separate landings 
of the two species.


# Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties
We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the 
vermilion/sunset complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within 
a single species and also between the two species.  Little biological data for south of 
Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed 
to better under biological parameters. 
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Conduct life history studies
     \item Conduct research to identify the proportion of each species in population and in catches
    \end{enumerate}


\item Take a closer look at the Ralston historical catch reconstruction (\cite{Ralston2010}) and 
all other historical data sources.

\item Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including 
a hierarchical structure and random effects. The CCFRP survey is the only 
fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky 
reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available, 
and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored 
since 2007.

\item Continue to investigate the most appropriate model structure for the NWFSC HL survey index.
The NWFSC HL survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat 
in the Southern California Bight. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey index given its expansion into the CCA, also independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey.Increased spatiotemporal sampling around Pt. Conception would aid in identifing stock boundaries.

\item Utilize existing ROV survey data sources

 \begin{enumerate}
     \item SWFSC Submersible Survey of the Cowcod Conservation Areaa (\cite{Yok2007}). 
    This was a line-transect survey designed to estimate cowcod abundance in 2002 conducted from a submersible inside the \gls{cca}.  Originally, only cowcod were enumerated from the video footage.  Over the last few years, the SWFSC has re-analyzed the video footage to enumerate other rockfish species. 
     \item The SWFSC Fishery Resource Division (FRD) conducted a survey of potential cowcod habitat between Point Conception and the U.S. – Mexico border from October through December of 2012 (\cite{Stierhoff2013}).
     \item SWFSC staff are submitting proposals to conduct an additional submirsible survey in the southern California Bight
      \item CDFW ROV survey data
    \end{enumerate}


\item Collection of length and age data are recommended for both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries.  Very little age data are available from either fishery for 
vermilion and sunset rockfishes.

\item Investigate possible environmental drivers/co-variates for biological parameters, 
particularly for recruitment.

\item Resolve differences between CalCOM and PacFIN expanded length composition data sets. 

\end{enumerate}

### Califronia Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling 
program in 1999 [@Monk2014].  California Polytechnic State University (Cal 
Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling 
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows 
the protocols established in Reilly et al. [-@Reilly1998]. 

During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records 
location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset 
of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a 
maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather 
to a specific fishing location.  The sampler also records the starting and 
ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures 
discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter 
the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for vermilion. 
Cal Poly has modified protocols  reflect sampling changes that CDFW 
has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at 
the level of a fisher’s bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in 
the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019.  The only difference is that 
Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.  

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either 
CDFW or Cal Poly in 2020.

**California CPFV CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes**

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical 
in that the same protocols are followed.  The only difference is that Cal Poly
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained 
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index 
selectivity is mirrored to the recreational 
fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead) 
fish.  Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length 
from CDFW sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and indlucded in the 
length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model. 

A number of filters are applied to these data.  All of the Cal Poly data were 
QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the 
data from CDFW.  Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and 
staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data. 

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution.  Reefs were 
developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material 
("Reef Delineation"). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly 
consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts 
north of Pt. Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-depthfished-cpfvonboard). The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are 
outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger 
areas considered as a factor in the index.

We retained 4481 drifts for index standardization, with 
1706 drifts encountering vermilion 
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-cpfvonboard)).  

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-cpfvonboard), \@ref(tab:tab-depth-cpfvonboard), and \@ref(tab:tab-year-cpfvonboard).

**California CPFV CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics**

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) 
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not 
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-cpfvonboard)). 

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 122.41 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-cpfvonboard)). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-cpfvonboard)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-cpfvonboard)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-cpfvonboard)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 62%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-cpfvonboard)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-cpfvonboard) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-cpfvonboard)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-cpfvonboard)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-cpfvonboard)).

### California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project Index

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project, [CCFRP](https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/), 
is a fishery-independent 
hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling 
locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs along the central California coast 
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015].  The CCFRP survey began in 2007 and was originally
designed as a statewide program in collaboration with NMFS scientists and fishermen. 
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored 
four MPAs consistently.  In 2017, 
the program was expanded coastwide within California.  The index of abundance was 
developed from the four MPAs sampled consistently (A&ntilde;o Nuevo and Point Lobos 
by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists a number 500 x 500 m cells both within and 
outside each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly 
selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells).  CPFVs are chartered 
for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for 
a fishing location.  During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 
30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured, 
and can be linked back to a particular angler, and released (or descended to depth). 
Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin 
clips that provide needed biological information for nearshore species. For the index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the 
fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.


*CCFRP Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes*

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little 
filtering was needed for the index. 
Cells not consistently sampled over time were excluded as well as cells that never encountered vermilion. CCFRP samples shallower 
depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality.  We retained 6532 drifts for index standardization, with 2250 drifts encountering vermilion.
  






*CCFRP Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics*

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-ccfrp) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-ccfrp).
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) 
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not 
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-ccfrp)). Plots of the arithmetic 
mean by inside (MPA) and outside (REF) MPAs over time is in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sitecpue-ccfrp).

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 362.81 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-ccfrp)). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-ccfrp)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and SITE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and SITE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-ccfrp)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-ccfrp)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 66%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-ccfrp)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-ccfrp) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-ccfrp)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-ccfrp)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-ccfrp)).

### CRFS Dockside Private Boat Index

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2018, 
were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number 
of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e. effort units are angler trips), 
angler-reported distance from shore, (Area.X: inside/outside of 3 nm, county, port, 
interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The sample size of the 
unfiltered private boat CPUE data is much larger than the crfspr CPFV data set, 
with 391,279 trips statewide, 120,655 in southern California (south 
of Point Conception), and 270,064 north of Point Conception. 

*CRFS Private Boat Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes*
Records were limited to “PR1” sites, and only the hook-and-line gear type 
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr). 
Since this is a dockside index lacking precise fishing location information, we 
use the percent of groundfish within the catch from a trip as a proxy for retaining 
trips for index standardization. Similar to the crfspr index, we partitioned the 
data into areas north and south of Point Conception and applied the method 
separately to each data set.

Since 2005, the recreational fishery for shelf rockfish north of Pt. Conception 
has been closed from January through part of April and May.Angler reported distance 
from shore had no samples in the “outside 3 nm” category (Area X = 2) 
from 2004-2011, but was retained in the index standardization due to the relaxation 
of depth restrictions beginning in 2017. We retained 59837 drifts for index standardization, with 21971 drifts encountering vermilion 
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-crfspr)).  


*Northern California CRFS Private Boat Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics*

Sample sizes by factors selected to model, excluding WAVE can be found in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-crfspr) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-crfspr).
We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) 
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not 
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-crfspr)). 

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 3718.2 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-crfspr)). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-crfspr)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-crfspr)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-crfspr)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 63%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-crfspr)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-crfspr) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-crfspr)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-crfspr)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-crfspr)).

### Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted 
by CDFW survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, [@Reilly1998]). During an onboard 
observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific 
catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers 
onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 
people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  The catch cannot be 
linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location.  The sampler 
also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting 
and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort 
data allow us to better filter the data for indices 
to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.


**Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes**

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data 
sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database [@Monk2016]. 
The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop  were recorded at a finer 
scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location 
information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch 
information.  Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers 
was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the 
vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number 
of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing 
stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for 
details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore 
excluded from the analysis (Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-debwv)). Sampling 
targeted areas of central California.  Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of 
those launched from port in District 6, which was removed from the analysis.


Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps 
and interpretation of hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).
Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes; 
Ft. Bragg to Santa Cruz (V1), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V2), San Luis Obispo to 
Pt. Conception (V3), and Offshore (deeper) locations including the Farallon 
Islands and reefs of Half Moon Bay and Monterey Bay (V4).  The ports in San 
Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and the arithmetic 
mean of CPUE by year was higher also higher in this area (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-debwv))
 
We retained 6597 drifts for index standardization, with 
2016 fishing location encountering vermilion.  
Tables of the number of samples and positive observervations by factor can be 
found in Tables (\@ref(tab:tab-depth-debwv), \@ref(tab:tab-region-debwv), and 
\@ref(tab:tab-year-debwv)).


**Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics**

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 313.12 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-debwv)). The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-debwv)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-debwv)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-debwv)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 69%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-debwv)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Lognormal models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-debwv) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-debwv)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-debwv)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-debwv)).

### MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index, 1980-1999

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of 
recreational CPFV fishing fleet. No MRFSS CPUE data are available for the years 
1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. Sampling of 
California CPFVs north of Point Conception was further delayed, and CPFV samples 
n 1993 and 1994 are limited to San Luis Obispo County. 
For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series was truncated at 1999 due 
to sampling overlap with the 
onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while 
onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for 
the same vessel). 

Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a 
single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a 
subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also 
identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers 
being interviewed.  The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. 
The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records 
belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).


**MRFSS CPUE Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes**

Trips recorded as having the primary area fished in Mexico or occurring in bays, e.g., 
San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition.
For indices representing only north of Pt. Conception, the years 1993-1994 were 
excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens2004] filtering approach was used to predict the 
probability of of catching vermilion, based 
on the species composition of the sampler observed catch in a given trip. Prior 
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative 
predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage 
(at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model.  The remaining 
25 all co-occurred with vermilion in at least one trip 
and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients 
from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive 
for species that are more likely to co-occur with vermilion, 
and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with vermilion 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sm-mrfss)).
The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with vermilion include
Gopher, Flag, Copper, Canary, and Starry rockfishes, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp 
habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were 
Chinook salmon, Widow and Greenspotted rockfishes, Chub mackerel and Rosy rockfish.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species 
assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of 
more than one species or species complex ("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch 
that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall 
[-@Stephens2004] recommended including all trips above a threshold where the 
false negatives and false positives are equally balanced.  However, this does 
not have any biological relevance and for this data set, we assume that if a 
vermilion was landed, the anglers had to have fished in appropriate habitat, 
especially given vermilion is strongly associated with rocky habitat.


The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence 
at which the rate of "false 
positives" equals "false negatives" of 0.35. The 
trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method 
including all the "false positive" trips, regardless of the probability of 
encountering vermilion. 
This assumes that if vermilion were caught, the anglers must have fished in 
appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is 
"sampler-examined" and the samplers are well trained in species identification.

Stephens and MacCall proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index 
standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives 
and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch 
a vermilion based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False 
negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a vermilion, given the 
catch composition, but caught at least one. The threshold probability that 
balances FP and FN excludes 
1182 
trips that did not catch a vermilion (52% 
of the trips), and 188 
trips (8% of the data) that 
caught a vermilion. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that 
catching a vermilion indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing 
effort occurred in habitat where vermilion occur. Only “true negatives” 
(the 1182 
trips that neither caught vermilion, nor were predicted to catch them by the model) 
were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included 
1083 trips, 70% 
of which encountered vermilion.  Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-mrfss) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-mrfss).



**MRFSS CPUE Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics**

Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be 
ill-fitting and the proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial 
models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that 
a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch 
per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. 
Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) 
and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore <3 nm, offshore >3 nm) 
factors were evaluated. Two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte 
to Santa Cruz ("N") and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo ("C") north of Pt. Conception. 
For models that span counties north and south of Pt. Conception, Santa Barbara to 
San Diego counties compose a third region ("S"). For models tha exclusively south 
of Pt. Conception, the region represent individual counties. Indices with a year 
and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average 
CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss)). 

A Lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 62.35 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss)).  The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-mrfss)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and SubRegion 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
NA 
was fit for the  Lognormal model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-mrfss)  and 
\@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-mrfss)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
proportion zeros similar to the 
30% 
zeroes in the observed data (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-mrfss)). 
The predicted marginal effects from both the binomial and Lognormal models 
can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-mrfss) and 
\@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-mrfss)). The final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-mrfss)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-mrfss)).
