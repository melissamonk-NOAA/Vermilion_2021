# Introduction

## Basic Information
This assessment reports the status of the 
Vermilion Rockfish (_Sebastes miniatus_) and Sunset Rockfish 
(_Sebastes crocotulus_) in U.S. waters off the coast of California south
  of Pt. Conception through 2020.

##Basic Information and Life History

*Population Structure and Complex Assessment Considerations*

Provided by John Harms (NWFSC)

A group of researchers from the NWFSC and SWFSC is collaborating on a project to genotype tissue specimens collected from the vermilion and sunset rockfish cryptic pair captured during the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the Southern CA Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey for the years 2004 - 2019.  Funding for this project was obtained through the Saltonstall-Kennedy program for FY 2020 through a proposal led by representatives from Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and the commercial passenger fishing vessel industry in southern California.  

After combining with specimens obtained through other collection efforts along the West Coast, approximately 25,000 tissue specimens will be analyzed.  Some earlier efforts to separate this cryptic pair to species used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers.  However, due to a one-way mitochondrial introgression from the vermilion genome into the sunset genome, a portion of the sunset rockfish population contains mitochondrial DNA sequences consistent with vermilion rockfish resulting in incorrect species assignments for these introgressed individuals during the prior research project.  The current research has identified a robust suite of genetic markers within the nuclear genomes of the two species that definitively separates vermilion and sunset rockfish (including  introgressed sunset rockfish), canary rockfish, first generation vermilion-sunset hybrids, and identifies emerging patterns of intraspecific stock structure within the two sister species.

Once the collected specimens have been genotyped, any species-specific differences in spatial and depth distribution, size composition, weight-length relationships, and other biological characteristics will be identified.  Using previously collected otoliths and ovaries, the demographics of the two species including age and growth and reproductive biology parameters such as length and age at 50\% maturity and the prevalence of skip spawning will be explored and compared.  These new genotyping results will be combined with data from the prior mtDNA work to  evaluate whether introgressed sunset rockfish represent a biologically intermediate subform of the species complex.  The effort also proposes to develop and test the efficacy of models to predict the relative proportion of the two species based upon explanatory variables including latitude, depth, species of co-occurrence, oceanographic parameters, habitat descriptors and/or other information.  The anticipated completion of the genotyping of all specimens is approximately December 2021 with provision of final results by the end of FY 2022.

This research is aimed at providing information to support the successful stock assessment of this commercially and recreationally valuable cryptic species pair and is responsive to any data gaps identified by the assessment community.  If successful, this research, conducted in close communication with stock assessors, may also assist the PFMC in establishing best practices for the assessment and management of cryptic species complexes.  Though this project will only focus on nominal vermilion rockfish specimens collected through the 2019 survey field season, it may be advisable that tissue specimens collected aboard fishery-independent surveys as well as through fishery-dependent programs continue to be genotyped on an ongoing basis to support continued and timely monitoring of this economically and ecologically important species complex.

## Biological Data


### Length and Age Compositions

Differences in length compositions and length-at-age were explored 
north and south of Pt. Conception prior to any modelling. There are 
currently no available data to separate sunset and vermilion rockfishes.


Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

*North of Pt. Conception*

* Commercial sources
  + CALCOM (1978-2020)
* Recreational sources
  + Miller and Gotshall dockside survey (1959-1960)
  + CPFV samples from Commercial port samplers (1978-1979)
  + Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard observer survey (1988-1998)
  + MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)
  + CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2019)
* Fishery-independent surveys
  + CCFRP hook-and-line survey (2007-2018)
  + West Coast Groundfish Bottown Trawl Survey (2003-2019)



*South of Pt. Conception*

* Commercial sources
  + CALCOM (1978-2020)
* Recreational sources
  + Ally et al. onboard observer survey (1986-1989)
  + Collins and Crooke onboard observer survey (1975-1978)
  + MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)
  + CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2018)
* Fishery-independent surveys
  + NWFSC Hook-and-Line Survey (2004-2019)
  + West Coast Groundfish Bottown Trawl Survey (2003-2019)



The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time} and Table xxx. 
Descriptions and details of the length composition data are in the above section 
for each fleet or survey.

### Age Structures


**External Fits to Growth**


Fits to the von Bertalanffy growth curve, 
$L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in 
years, $k$ is rate of increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ 
is the asymptotic length, were explore by species and sex. 



### Ageing Precision and Bias

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 357 vermilion rockfish 
otoliths with two age reads between the NWFSC (reader 1, B. Kamikawa) and the 
SWFSC (reader 2, D. Watters) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-reader1reader2)).
Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described 
above. The same readers aged otoliths for both vermilion rockfish stock assessmetnt models. 
Age reader 1 read all of the otoliths for the southern model and both readers read 
otoliths for the northern California model. In addition to the otoliths from these 
two regions, the same two readers aged fish for a Committee of Age Reading Experts 
(CARE)exchange among four ageing labs, initiated by the SWFSC.

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software [@Thorson2012].
The software setting for bias was set to unbiased for reader 1 who was more 
experienced. The $\Delta AIC$ among the top three models was less than two. The 
best fitting model selected curvilinear bias for reader 1 and curvilinear standard 
deviation for both readers.  
An analysis of ageing error removing one fish aged at 88 by reader 1 and 78 by reader 2 
selected the the model with reader 2 as unbiased and curvilinear standard deviation 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-oldfish)). The reading of the oldest aged fish falls within the 95\% confidence 
internal using this model (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-truereads)).  
The latter model was selected for use in the assessment. 
 

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings 
increasing from 0.001 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.37 years at age 70, 
the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.



### Maturation and Fecundity



### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT; https://github.com/shcaba/Natural-Mortality-Tool), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel [-@Hamel2015] method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. [-@Then2018] functional regression model and is a commomly applied method for west coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user. 




### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 


### Length-Weight Relationship

The length(cm)-weight(kg) relationship for vermilion rockfish was estimated outside the 
model using California biological data available from fishery-independent 
data sources. The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was $W$=1.744e-05$L$^3^ and males at $W$=1.744e-05$L$^3^ (Figure xx).



### Steepness

The Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (developed for use West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) and reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017, has been a primary source of information on steepness for rockfishes. This approach, however, was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 prior for steepness ($h$; beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.15) is retained.

## Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index of Abundance{#debwv}







































### Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted 
by CDFW survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, [@Reilly1998]). During an onboard 
observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific 
catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers 
onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 
people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  The catch cannot be 
linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location.  The sampler 
also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting 
and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort 
data allow us to better filter the data for indices 
to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.


**Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Data Preparation, Filtering, and Sample Sizes**

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data 
sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database [@Monk2016]. 
The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop  were recorded at a finer 
scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location 
information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch 
information.  Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers 
was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the 
vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number 
of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing 
stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for 
details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore 
excluded from the analysis (Table \@ref(tab:tab-data-filter-debwv)). Sampling 
targeted areas of central California.  Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of 
those launched from port in District 6, which was removed from the analysis.


Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps 
and interpretation o hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).
Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes; 
Ft. Bragg to Santa Cruz (V1), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V2), San Luis Obispo to 
Pt. Conception (V3)", and Offshore (deeper) locations including the Farallon 
Islands and reefs of Half Moon Bay and Monterey Bay (V4).  The ports in San 
Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and CPUE is 
also higher in this area (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-debwv))
 
We retained 6597 drifts for index standardization, with 
2016 fishing location encountering vermilion.  
Tables of the number of samples and positive observervations by factor can be 
found in Tables (\@ref(tab:tab-depth-debwv), \@ref(tab:tab-region-debwv), and 
\@ref(tab:tab-year-debwv)).


**Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index: Model Selection, Fits, and Diagnostics**

AA Gamma model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 5529.18 over a Lognormal model.  The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-select-debwv)), 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and MegaReef and WAVE and DEPTH_bin 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and MegaReef and WAVE and DEPTH_bin 
was fit for the  Gamma model.
Models were fit using the “rstanarm” R package (version 2.21.1). Posterior predictive 
checks of the Bayesian model fit for the binomial model and the positive model 
were all reasonable (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-mean-debwv)  and 
 \@ref(fig:fig-posterior-sd-debwv)). The binomial model generated data sets with the 
 proportion zeros similar to the 69%  zeroes in the observed data 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-propzero-debwv)). The predicted marginal effects from 
both the binomial and Gamma models can be found in (Figures \@ref(fig:fig-Dbin-marginal-debwv) and \@ref(fig:fig-Dpos-marginal-debwv)). The 
final index (Table \@ref(tab:tab-index-debwv)) 
represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-cpue-debwv)).
