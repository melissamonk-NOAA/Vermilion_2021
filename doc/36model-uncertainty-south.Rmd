# Assessment Model Diagnostics

## Sensitivity to Assumptions, Data, and Weighting

All sensitivities in this section use the **pre-STAR** base model.


To better understand how data from individual fishery sectors or scientific surveys affected assessment results, we excluded data sets from the likelihood, one fleet at a time (referred to here as a “drop-one” analysis). “Fleet” in this sense refers to either a fishing fleet or a survey “fleet.” To do this, we set “lambdas” (multipliers for each likelihood component) equal to zero. This is equivalent to removing the data from the model. When composition data were excluded, the selectivity parameters for that fleet were fixed at the base model estimates to standardize the size and age composition of harvested fish. When abundance indices were excluded, relevant catchability and ‘extraSE’ parameters associated with the index were not estimated. Composition data weights for the remaining fleets were kept consistent with the base model values. Results from all the ‘drop-one’ runs were compared to the base model using time series plots and tables containing likelihood components, parameter estimates and derived quantities.


For the southern California model, the NWFSC hook-and-line (HKL) survey is divided across two fleets (8 and 12; see survey description in the Fishery-Independent Data sources section). For consistency with other ‘drop-one’ runs, fleets 8 and 12 were excluded at the same time to remove all data associated with the hook-and-line survey. Removal of the HKL survey fleet (index, length comps, and age comps) resulted in larger estimates of unfished spawning output (Figure \@ref(fig:drop-spawnbio)), and affected the trend in spawning biomass in recent years. Only removal of the REC_PC fleet had a noticeable effect on spawning output in the terminal year, but the difference was well within the estimated range of uncertainty from the base model. Relative spawning output (‘depletion’) estimates showed little change relative to the range of plausible outcomes predicted by the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:drop-bratio)). Removal of the REC_PC fleet reduced the magnitude of negative recruitment deviations estimated in the 1970s, as well as the strength of the 1999 year class (Figure \@ref(fig:drop-recdev)), but most general patterns in recruitment were consistent across the set of drop-one sensitivity tests. Changes in likelihoods, parameter estimates and derived quantities are recorded in Tables \@ref(tab:drop-one) and \@ref(tab:drop-one2). Comparison of likelihoods among drop-one scenarios should be treated with caution due to changes in the data sets that were fit in each model run.

### Sensitivity to Catch Uncertainty
To evaluate the influence of highly uncertain catch histories, we developed several sensitivity analyses.  A “typical” sensitivity is to both halve and double historical catches, which tend to be far more uncertain than catches in the more recent and better documented era, particularly for rockfish (*Sebastes*).  This is because historically most rockfish were landed in mixed stock market categories such as “unspecified rockfish” or “group red rockfish,” and the species composition of these market categories were not sampled until the recent era (1978 in central and northern California, 1983 in the Southern California Bight).  However, as described in the historical catch section, recent evaluations have suggested that historical catches in the Southern California Bight may be more uncertain than previously realized.  Specifically, vermilion rockfish was explicitly described as “one of the most important commercial species, it is one of the three leading species (of rockfish) in "southern California" [@Roedel1948].  The other two of the most important commercial species in southern waters were bocaccio, which is estimated to represented nine percent of total rockfish catch in southern waters between 1916 and 1950, and 20% between 1916 and 1968; and chilipepper, estimated to represent 11% of the catch between 1916 and 1950 and 14% between 1916 and 1968.  However, the catch reconstruction estimated that vermilion rockfish catch to be less than five percent of the historical total for this region, while several species that were not described or described as “minor” importance were estimated to represent 10% or more of the catch (including bank, blackgill, bronzespotted and cowcod rockfish).  The former two in particular are more deeply distributed slope species that were unlikely to represent a large fraction of catches in the 1920s and 1930s [@Miller2014].  

One partial explanation for the discrepancy is that market category 959, which is described as “group red” rockfish was rarely used until the late 1930s and early 1940s, but likely accounted for much of the vermilion rockfish catch from that period onward.  Thus, vermilion rockfish would have been included in other market categories, such as market category 250, “unspecified rockfish,” which accounted for half of the total rockfish catch early in the historical period.  By the time species composition data were actually collected in the early 1980s, that market category would have very few vermilion rockfish, as most would have been sorted into “group red” or the “vermilion rockfish” (249) market categories.  Consequently, when recent species composition data were applied to the historical market category catches, the fraction estimated to be vermilion rockfish would be biased low, and vermilion rockfish would be underrepresented in the earliest portion of the landings history.  To evaluate a plausible alternative to the current estimates, we evaluated the consequences of assuming that both 10% and 20% of the total rockfish catches in the Southern California Bight were vermilion rockfish (comparable to the other two “leading species”).  This effect would have likely been reduced from the late 1950s and early 1960s onward, thus for these sensitivities we only applied the higher catch levels to the pre-1969 time period (e.g., the time period of the historical reconstruction).  These sensitivities were done in addition to both halving and doubling catches (both commercial and recreational) for the entire pre-1980 time period. 

The halving and doubling of catches did lead to substantive differences in estimates of stock status, with a slightly more pessimistic perception in the doubling of historical catches and a slightly more optimistic perception in the halving (Figures \@ref(fig:sens2-depl) and \@ref(fig:sens2-spr)).  However, the treatment of only pre-1969 commercial catches did not lead to substantive changes in the perception of stock status, only a slight scaling of historical spawning output and an increase in historical harvest rates, resulted in a considerably earlier and more rapid stock decline relative to the base model.  Associated with that increased scaling of historical spawning output was a slight increase in the equilibrium MSY level, by one to three tons depending on the scenario.  The halving and doubling of all historical catches prior to 1980 had a more substantive effect on the estimated equilibrium MSY level, decreasing by approximately four tons and increasing by ~18 tons, respectively.  However, there is less evidence to support a doubling of both relatively recent (60s through 70s) commercial catches and of recreational catches at this time.  Given the relatively modest influence on the model results, and the need for more rigorous investigations and improvements to historical catch estimates (which are best done as an overarching effort on all historical catches), additional efforts to improve these estimates are likely more appropriate for future research recommendations.  

### Other Model Sensitivities
Results from the **pre-STAR** base model were compared to several alternative model specifications, as described below.

- Estimate the Beverton-Holt steepness parameter (*h*) rather than fixing it at the prior mean   (*h*=0.72); estimate uncertainty intervals for comparison to base
- Start recruitment deviations 5 years earlier than the base model configuration
- Start recruitment deviations 5 years later than the base model configuration
- Compare results based on the McAllister-Ianelli data weighting method (for composition data) to the Francis method used for the base model. 
- Mirror the recreational discard fleets’ selectivity curves to the corresponding retained fleets (PC or PR) rather than fitting to discard length comps as in the base model.


Trends in spawning output for the southern California assessment model were generally robust to this set of sensitivities. However, recent estimates of spawning output were much lower when using McAllister-Ianelli data weights, relative to the Francis method used in the base model (Figure \@ref(fig:sens1-spawnb)). The model tuned to McAllister-Ianelli weights was below target biomass, while the other models that used Francis weights showed similar trends in depletion and were above target biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:sens1-bratio)). The McAllister-Ianelli approach estimated a natural mortality rate that was about 20% lower than the Francis method (Tables \@ref(tab:sens1)). Best estimates from all runs were within the estimated range of uncertainty for the base model. Steepness in the southern region was estimated at a similar value than the prior mean (estimated at 0.77 vs. fixed at 0.72), and estimation of this parameter did not have a large effect on uncertainty in spawning output or recruitment deviations. The use of McAllister-Ianelli weights had the greatest impact on estimated recruitment deviations (Figure \@ref(fig:sens1-recdevs)). This weighting method increased the variance of the estimated deviations as well as the estimated strength of the 1999 year class, relative to the models using the Francis approach. Changing the start date of the recruitment deviations had almost no effect. The McAllister-Ianelli method gives greater weight to the composition data for this model (Table \@ref(tab:data-weights)).  

During the STAR panel review, the STAT presented results from several sensitivity runs that were completed after distribution of the draft assessment document. All runs were conducted with the pre-STAR base models. These included:  
- Fixing the natural mortality rate (M) to a value consistent with the observed maximum age when applying the Hamel prior (i.e., M = 5.4/80 = 0.07 $yr^{-1}$)  
- Assuming asymptotic (2-parameter) selectivity curves for all fleets, except for recreational discard and the NWFSC trawl survey)  
- Estimating domed (4-parameter) selectivity curves for all fleets, but allowing for asymptotic shapes when supported by the data.  
- Use of a 3-parameter, reparameterized Ricker stock-recruitment relationship instead of a standard, 2-parameter Beverton-Holt relationship.  
- “Direct” estimation of male natural mortality and growth parameters, in contrast to the base model, which uses an exponential offset parameterization for male parameters and fixes male M = female M.  
- Reduce the input variance of the NWFSC HKL index, forcing the model to fit the index better.  

The STAT compared several results from these runs to the pre-STAR base model, including time series of spawning output, relative spawning output, and recruitment deviations (Figures \@ref(fig:sens3a), \@ref(fig:sens3b), and \@ref(fig:sens3c)). Negative log likelihoods (total and by data type), parameter estimates, and derived quantities were also examined relative to the pre-STAR base (Table \@ref(tab:sens3)). Fixing M at 0.07 degraded the overall fit to the data, increasing the likelihood by more than 38 points. The model with forced asymptotic selectivity did not converge (parameters hit bounds), estimated a natural mortality rate that was inconsistent with the observed ages (M=0.26) and had a higher total negative likelihood. Estimating 4 selectivity parameters per fleet (excluding the discard and NWFSC trawl survey) produced results similar to the pre-base model. The STAT notes that the post-STAR base model allowed for greater flexibility in time-varying selectivity for the commercial hook-and-line fleet, relative to the pre-STAR base, so results from this sensitivity may differ if applied to the post-STAR base model. Parameters from a reparameterized Ricker stock-recruitment relationship were estimable (Table \@ref(tab:sens3)) with M fixed at 0.12, but produced results that were generally consistent with the Beverton-Holt relationship assumed in the base model. However, uncertainty in spawning output and relative stock status were greatly increased under the 3-parameter Ricker model (Figures \@ref(fig:sens3a) and \@ref(fig:sens3b)). Sex-specific estimates of the natural mortality rate were similar to the combined estimate in the base model, and within one standard deviation based on reported asymptotic standard errors of the parameters. Lastly, reducing the input standard errors for the NWFSC hook-and-line survey had the expected effect of improving the fit to the index, but degraded the overall model fit (Table \@ref(tab:sens3)). The improved fit to the hook-and-line index was mainly accomplished through a reduction in the estimated natural mortality rate, slowing the rate of population increase to better match the index.



## Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for natural mortality ($M$), steepness ($h$) and the log of R0 (unfished recruitment) by fixing these parameters across a range of values and continuing to estimate the remaining parameters assuming the base model framework.  All models in this section use the **post-STAR** base models.


The profiles for natural mortality in the southern base model (Figures \@ref(fig:m-profile), \@ref(fig:m-depl), \@ref(fig:m-spawn), \@ref(fig:m-recruits), and \@ref(fig:m-recdevs)) suggest that this parameter is reasonably well informed between a range of approximately 0.11 and 0.14.  The profiles suggest a somewhat commonly observed phenomena of tension between the age data, which would suggest a lower natural mortality rate, and the length and index data, which tend to fit the data better with a higher value for $M$.  The notable exceptions to these generalizations include the NWFSC hook and line survey index, which fits the data better with a considerably lower $M$, and the commercial fisheries data (hook-and-line, and setnet), which also fit the data better with a lower $M$.  Intuitively, spawning output increased with lower natural mortality rate estimates, while the estimate of relative stock status was more pessimistic, while the converse was true (lower spawning output, more optimistic stock status estimates) with higher $M$ values. 

A profile of steepness was conducted on values ranging from 0.30 to 0.90 in 0.10 increments.  The resulting likelihood profiles (by component, and by component and fleet) are shown as Figure \@ref(fig:h-profile), while model trajectories (spawning output, relative depletion, age-0 recruits and recruitment deviations) are shown as Figures \@ref(fig:h-spawn),  \@ref(fig:h-depl), \@ref(fig:h-recruits), and \@ref(fig:h-recdevs).  The likelihood profiles show that the overall best fit to the data is associated with high steepness values, although the data were generally uninformative above steepness values of 0.5.  Overall the length data were not very informative, and there were some odd changes in the likelihood in some fleets at very low (0.3) steepness values.  Similarly the age data were only marginally informative, and suggested higher steepness values in general.  Most of the indices also suggested higher steepness values, particularly the NWFSC hook and line survey index, although the Rec PC index had a significantly better fit at lower steepness values.  Predictably, spawning output scaled down with higher steepness values and up with lower values, however the estimate of stock status in 2021 varied relatively little across the range of values.  Interestingly the most optimistic runs with respect to relative stock status were both the highest and the lowest values in the profile, although the overall difference was negligible for the ending year. The higher steepness runs were more pessimistic with respect to historical (late 1980s through the early 2000s) stock status.  
 
A profile on the log of unfished recruitment (Ln R0) was conducted on values ranging from 6.2 to 6.9 (the base model estimate in base model was 6.66).  In general, age data was better fit by the model with lower values of R0, survey data (as well as recruitment via likelihood penalties) were better fit by higher R0 values, and the cumulative fit to length data was best close to the base model estimate (Figure \@ref(fig:r0-profile)).  The components by fleet were variable in the cases of length composition data, in which the commercial hook and line fishery and the Rec PC data fit better with lower R0 values, while the remaining fleets fit better with higher R0 values or were non-informative (Figures \@ref(fig:r0-depl), \@ref(fig:r0-spawn), \@ref(fig:r0-recruits), and \@ref(fig:r0-recdevs)).  Spawning output is estimated to be greater with the higher R0 values and lower with the lower R0 values, as a result of corresponding model changes in the estimate of the natural mortality rate (which is estimated to be much lower in the low R0 model).  This results in the lower R0 runs also being more pessimistic, as the lower R0 runs were associated with considerably lower natural mortality rates.  Additional profiles in which M is fixed may be helpful in evaluating model performance across many of the key model parameters.

## Retrospective Analysis

All models in this section use the **post-STAR** base model.


A five year retrospective analysis was conducted on the southern base model by sequentially removing data, beginning with data from the year 2020.  Figures \@ref(fig:retro-spawnb), \@ref(fig:retro-bratio), \@ref(fig:retro-recruits), and \@ref(fig:retro-recdevs) show the estimated spawning output, the estimated depletion, and recruitment deviation estimates.  The greatest impact was the declining estimate of the strength of the 2016 year class, similar to the northern model, with the interesting result that with the loss of only 1-3 years of data the model attributes greater recruitment to 2015 relative to the base model, with variable responses among other recruitment estimates.  This change is associated with an increasingly pessimistic perception of stock status, although the overall scaling of spawning output is relatively modest.  This shift is understandably associated with the change in population trajectory as data supporting strong recent recruitment are removed.  Beyond this shift, this analysis does not suggest that there are substantive retrospective patterns (Table \@ref(tab:retro)).  Note that all composition data weights were held constant at the base model values during each run.


## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

Uncertainty around the magnitude of historical vermilion rockfish catches may be higher in this region, as some accounts suggest considerably higher historical catches than estimated in the 2010 catch reconstruction.  

The primary fishery-independent survey for west coast groundfish, the NWC WCGBTS, does not sample rocky habitats where most vermilion rockfish are found, and thus does not provide a robust index of abundance (and was excluded from this assessment).  The NWFSC hook and line survey provides demographic and relative abundance data throughout the Southern California Bight, with the exception of some state closed areas. 

While recent age data are robust, based primarily on the NWFSC hook-and-line survey, historical age data (both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) are very limited.  The likelihood profiles suggest a somewhat commonly seen pattern of tension among data sources, with age data suggesting a lower natural mortality rate and length data (as well as most index data) suggesting a higher $M$.  Natural mortality appears to be reasonably well estimated but is still uncertain, and seems to have the greatest influence on scaling the relative biomass and stock trajectory. 

The model estimates a series of very low recruitment events through the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period in which many other rockfish in this region experienced high levels of recruitment.  Recruitment patterns in more recent years generally follow those for other stocks.  It is possible that selectivity patterns changed, data are biased, model misspecification, or unknown ecosystem interactions could be responsible for this pattern.
